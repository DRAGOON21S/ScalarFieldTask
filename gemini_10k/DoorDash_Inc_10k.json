Our mission is to grow and empower local economies.\nTechnology has changed consumer behavior and driven a wave of demand for convenience. Consumers’ expectations of\nease and immediacy with every purchase has been a boon for some companies but damaging for many others. We enable\nlocal brick-and-mortar businesses—which are fundamental to the vitality of local economies and communities—to\naddress consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven economy. Our\nlocal logistics platform connects over 450,000 merchants 1 , over 20 million consumers 2 , and over 1 million\nDashers 3 in the United States, Canada, and Australia every month.\nWe built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through the\nDoorDash Marketplace, or our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve\nmission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment\nprocessing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand\ntheir reach. It generates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants\ncan fulfill this demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by\nconsumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a\nvariety of products, which we refer to as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated\nthrough their own channels. DoorDash Drive, or Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants that\nhave generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our local logistics\nplatform. DoorDash Storefront, or Storefront, enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering\nexperience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without\ninvesting in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nTHE DOORDASH PLATFORM\nOur local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. We built our local logistics platform to\nserve the needs of these three key constituencies and to become more intelligent and efficient with every order. As\nwe have grown, the scale of our local logistics platform has become one of our major competitive advantages and\ndelivers substantial benefits to everyone we serve. We connect:\nMerchants: Over 450,000 merchants run and grow their businesses using our technology platform. Our products are\ndesigned to meet the individual needs of merchants, regardless of their scale, business model, or location. Our\nMarketplace includes business enablement and demand fulfillment services that enable merchants to solve mission-\ncritical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment\nprocessing, and customer support. We help our merchants thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven economy while\nenabling them to focus on their craft.\nConsumers: Over 20 million consumers discover, engage with, and purchase goods from merchants on our local\nlogistics platform. For consumers, we offer the ability to order from the best of their communities with the click\nof a button and to have their orders reliably delivered or waiting at the store for pickup. We enable convenience\nfor consumers throughout their entire day, from breakfast pickup on-the-go to catered lunch at work to grocery or\ndinner delivery straight to their doorsteps. We believe that the convenient access we provide to an unmatched\n1 Based on the number of individual stores, including Drive stores, that have completed an order through our\nplatform in the past month, measured as of December 31, 2020.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplace in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2020.\n3 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past month,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2020.\n6\nTable o f Contents\ncombination of selection, experience, and value for consumers helps drive consumer engagement and category-leading\nspend retention. 4\nDashers: Over 1 million Dashers use our local logistics platform to find opportunities to earn. For Dashers, we\nprovide opportunities for those looking for a fast and flexible way to earn and to achieve their goals. We also\nprovide earnings transparency so that Dashers can make informed decisions about the deliveries they choose to make.\nDashers set their own schedules and we work to ensure that the time they spend making deliveries is well rewarded.\nWe do not require Dashers to deliver by car as they also have the option to deliver by bike or scooter, enabling a\nbroad range of people to deliver on our platform.\nOur local logistics platform benefits from three powerful virtuous cycles:\nLocal Network Effects: Our ability to attract more merchants, including local favorites and national brands,\ncreates more selection in our Marketplace, driving more consumer engagement, and in turn, more sales for merchants\non our platform. Our strong national merchant footprint enables us to launch new markets and quickly establish a\ncritical mass of merchants and Dashers, driving strong consumer adoption.\nEconomies of Scale: As more consumers join our local logistics platform and their engagement increases, our\nentire platform benefits from higher order volume, which means more revenue for local businesses and more\nopportunities for Dashers to work and increase their earnings. This, in turn, attracts Dashers to our local\nlogistics platform, which allows for faster and more efficient fulfillment of orders for consumers.\nIncreasing Brand Affinity: Both our local network effects and economies of scale lead to more merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our local logistics platform. As we scale, we continue to invest in improving\nour offerings for merchants, selection, experience, and value for consumers, and earnings opportunities for\nDashers. By improving the benefits of our local logistics platform for each of our three constituencies, our\nnetwork continues to grow and we benefit from increased brand awareness and positive brand affinity. With increased\nbrand affinity, we expect that we will enjoy lower acquisition costs for all three constituencies in the long term.\nSince our founding, over 1.2 billion orders have been completed through our platform. These orders inform our\nmachine learning algorithms and generate a data advantage in which the technology and value of our local logistics\nplatform is\n4 Edison Trends. Based on the estimated dollar value of orders placed on DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats by a\ngroup of users that first placed an order on any such platform between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, as\ndetermined by Edison Trends. For each platform, spend retention represents the total dollar value of orders placed\nby this group of users in their twelfth month on the platform as a percentage of the total dollar value of orders\nplaced by such group in their first month. Postmates is excluded due to inconsistent data availability in April and\nMay 2020; however, Postmates’ spend retention was lower than DoorDash in all other months of the measurement\nperiod.\n7\nTable o f Contents\ncontinuously enhanced as more constituencies are connected in our network and greater amounts of data are brought\ninto our platform. We leverage insights from this data to drive actionable recommendations for merchants regarding\nconsumer preferences and market trends. For example, as merchants think about growth and expansion, our data\ninsights can help guide their decisions on menu options, hours of operation, and where to build their next\nstorefront. Our data insights also give us unique visibility into the operations of the local businesses in our\nnetwork. For example, understanding the differences in kitchen preparation time for a sandwich versus sushi enables\nus to improve Dasher efficiency and improve the consumer experience. As more orders are completed on our local\nlogistics platform, our data insights grow and continue to enhance the experience for all three constituencies,\nwhich in turn strengthens our competitive advantage.\nOUR GROWTH STRATEGY\nWe intend to broaden our network of merchants by providing innovative services that help merchants operate and grow\ntheir businesses.\nMore merchants. We have experienced tremendous success serving merchants, primarily in the food vertical. We have\nover 450,000 merchants, the majority of which are restaurants, on our local logistics platform today, and there are\nmany more that we have yet to reach. We will continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and sales efforts to\ncontinue adding new merchants. Over time, we plan to continue adding more merchants from verticals outside of food\nas well as DashMarts, our first party owned-and-operated convenience stores.\nMore merchant services. We provide a range of products and services, such as our Marketplace, Drive, and\nStorefront, to help our merchants operate and grow their businesses. We will continue to innovate and introduce new\nproducts and services to add value for our merchants and unlock additional revenue opportunities for DoorDash.\nWe seek to increase consumer adoption and have DoorDash become a daily activity.\nMore consumers. There are over 20 million consumers on our local logistics platform. We plan to continue to\nincrease our consumer reach, both in the United States and internationally. We launched in Australia, in September\n2019, and have a strong and growing business in Canada.\nMore consumer engagement. Today, consumers use our local logistics platform for a small fraction of their monthly\nmeals. In the food vertical, we strive to increase the frequency with which consumers use DoorDash by being the\nmost delicious, affordable, and convenient way to eat. We plan to do this by increasing the breadth of restaurant\nselection, expanding availability of meals at all times of the day, addressing the needs of business consumers via\nDoorDash for Work, which includes large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events, and enhancing\naffordability by increasing adoption of DashPass, our subscription product, which eliminates per-order delivery\nfees with partner merchants. We will also continue to seek partnership opportunities to extend the benefits of\nDashPass to more consumers. In addition, as we continue to add new verticals beyond food, we expect to further\nincrease the amount of consumer spend on our platform and broaden the benefits of DashPass.\nWe seek to build a reliable, high quality, and operationally efficient logistics network.\nBetter consumer experience. Our goal is to delight consumers, thereby promoting their use of our platform and\nmaking it easier for us to acquire new consumers. We continue to make investments aimed at improving the consumer\nexperience. We are particularly focused on building tools to help Dashers improve the accuracy of items delivered\nand the speed and timeliness of delivery, without sacrificing selection.\nBetter Dasher experience. We also invest in improving Dasher experience and satisfaction. This includes improving\nonboarding and enabling Dashers to sign up and start earning faster. For example, we developed our local logistics\nplatform to provide earnings visibility after every delivery in an easy and transparent manner, and through our\nFast Pay service, we enable Dashers to receive their earnings on-demand, rather than on a weekly basis.\nImprove operational efficiency. We are focused on optimizing our cost structure primarily through product\nimprovements meant to enhance the operational efficiency and quality of our local logistics platform. These\nimprovements include enhancements to our batching algorithms and order preparation and traffic predictions.\nOUR OFFERINGS\n8\nTable o f Contents\nOur offerings provide merchants, consumers, and Dashers with a local logistics platform that offers access to\nconvenience and opportunity.\nOfferings for Merchants\nWe have carefully designed our local logistics platform with a merchant-first approach. Our merchant services\ninclude business enablement and demand fulfillment services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical\nchallenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and\ncustomer support. Our local logistics platform provides merchants with the mission-critical capabilities needed to\nmeet the demands of the convenience economy and capture the business growth that comes from this new wave of\ndemand.\nMerchant tablet and software portal. Partner merchants use our tablets and our merchant software portal for\nholistic views of their businesses. Our self-service capabilities enable merchants to directly onboard to our local\nlogistics platform and monitor their businesses in real time.\nMerchant services that we offer for demand fulfillment include:\nMarketplace. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It\ngenerates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with over 20 million consumers. Merchants can fulfill\nthis demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or by taking advantage of in-person\npickup or self-delivery, as described below. As part of our Marketplace, we also offer:\n◦ Pickup. Pickup allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with\nno consumer fees. We believe Pickup generates additional foot traffic for our merchants and drives incremental\nsales.\n◦ DoorDash for Work. DoorDash for Work provides our merchants with large group orders and catering orders for\nbusinesses and events. Merchants benefit from such orders due to their large dollar value, which helps drive\nprofitability, and the advance nature of such orders, which helps merchants plan better.\n◦ Self-Delivery. Self-Delivery enables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery\nfleets.\nDrive. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand that they have\nalready created through their own channels but do not have the in-house distribution capacity to fulfill. Many\nnational merchants, such as Chipotle, Wingstop, and Little Caesars, invest significant capital in building their\nown mobile applications and websites to enable consumers to interact with their brands and order online. These\nmerchants need the ability to address the off-premise consumer demand they have created without having to build and\nmanage their own logistics operations. Through Drive, merchants are able to connect with Dashers and leverage our\nlocal logistics platform to fulfill their orders.\nDoorDash Storefront. Storefront enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience,\nproviding them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-\nhouse engineering or logistics capabilities.\nOur Marketplace includes a variety of services, beyond demand fulfillment, that enable merchants’ businesses:\nCustomer acquisition. DoorDash connects merchants with over 20 million consumers. Merchants can also use DoorDash\nto initiate and run promotions to attract new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nConsumer engagement . We provide merchants with the tools to attract and engage consumers or win back consumers\nwho have not ordered from them recently. Merchants can also feature new items or details about their individual\nstores.\nMerchandising strategy and personalization. Our merchandising strategy allows us to feature certain merchants or\nproducts. For example, we often curate and feature “Local Picks” prominently to showcase new merchants or recent\ntrends. Our machine learning algorithms further personalize selection based on individual consumer order patterns\nand other factors.\nPayment processing. DoorDash handles payment acceptance from consumers primarily through a third-party payment\nprocessor that manages credit card transaction processing, which means merchants do not need to be concerned with\ncredit card authorization, chargebacks, or fraud. Partner merchants and Dashers have accounts directly with the\npayment processor and we remit payments to merchants and Dashers through the payment processor. When Dashers pick\nup from a non-partner merchant, they are authorized to pay for the purchased goods with a DoorDash-issued debit\ncard.\n9\nTable o f Contents\nSelf-service. Merchants are able to use the merchant software portal and our Merchant Tablet Order Manager to\nself-edit menus, update business hours and pricing, and provide additional information about their businesses.\nInsights and analytics. Our merchant software portal allows merchants to track business performance on a number\nof metrics, including how long a Dasher waits for an order, order accuracy, analyses on top-performing items, and\nreports on incremental sales. Merchants can use this information to more effectively manage their operational\nprocesses and inventory and price items at competitive rates. The data we track enables insights that help\nmerchants understand their consumer base, identify new ways to drive business, and improve the quality of the\ndelivery experience.\nCustomer support. We provide customer support for any orders placed through our local logistics platform. Our\ncustomer support centers address both order and logistics issues, and we work together with merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers to resolve disputes.\nIntegrations. DoorDash seamlessly integrates with merchants’ existing systems and workflows to streamline\noperations. Integration with merchant POS systems not only eliminates the need for merchants to monitor and\nmaintain a tablet but also helps improve the delivery experience. For example, merchants with POS integration\ngenerally experience a reduction in how long a Dasher waits for an order and the number of missing or incorrect\nitems in an order. We are also able to integrate into existing workflows through which merchants receive their\norders, including website, email, tablet, phone, and fax. We do this because we are a merchant-first company and\nstrive to integrate seamlessly with our merchants’ existing operational processes.\nOfferings for Consumers\nFor consumers, our local logistics platform serves as a search engine to the local economy. Our consumer offerings\nprovide a frictionless and personalized experience to search, discover, and order from local businesses. Both our\nconsumer mobile application and website help consumers decide what to order with relevant information about each\nmerchant, visually-rich photos, and filters to make it simple and efficient to find the right merchants and items.\nConsumer mobile application and website. Our consumer mobile application and website provide consumers with\naccess to a wide selection of merchants in our Marketplace. Consumers can search by delivery time, price, rating,\nand other categories (such as type of cuisine for restaurant merchants) to find the merchant and items that satisfy\ntheir needs. Consumers can also easily browse merchants around them to discover new merchants or goods that cater\nto their preferences. Our proprietary technology enhances the consumer experience by displaying merchants according\nto a consumer’s preferences and other factors such as delivery times and ratings. Our ability to serve consumers\nwith a personalized selection of merchants that reflects our understanding of their preferences allows us to enable\nthe discovery and curation of merchants for our consumers. We also enable consumers to place orders individually as\nwell as order as a group.\nOnce a merchant is selected, consumers can customize orders according to their preferences. Our mobile application\nand website provide real-time notifications and order tracking so that consumers can closely follow their orders\nfrom the moment they are placed to when they are delivered. We also offer consumers the ability to easily contact\nDashers, and vice-versa, to ensure a seamless delivery experience. Our local logistics platform also allows\nconsumers to easily contact our support team so that issues are efficiently resolved, which provides the ability\nfor us to turn a problem into an opportunity to engage and build loyalty with consumers.\nDashPass. Our subscription product, DashPass, serves as a membership program to the physical world and offers\nconsumers unlimited access to eligible merchants with $0 delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible orders.\nDashPass currently costs $9.99 per month for a monthly membership. DashPass enables us to reward our most engaged\nconsumers with savings on the cost of delivery and to reward DashPass-eligible merchants by featuring them to our\nmost engaged consumers.\nPickup . Pickup allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines and save time, and pick up items directly\nfrom the merchant.\nOfferings for Dashers\nUnderpinning our offerings for Dashers is our proprietary technology that enables Dashers to work where, when, and\nhow they want while keeping them busy so they can earn more money in less time.\nWe enable Dashers to easily sign up anytime and anywhere . After clearing a background check, new Dashers can\nquickly and easily onboard onto our local logistics platform. We place great value on flexibility and provide\nDashers with a choice to either visit a local office for personal assistance or stay in the comfort of their own\nhome to onboard wherever they are.\n10\nTable o f Contents\nTransparency for Dashers . Through the dedicated Dasher mobile application, DoorDash strives to offer Dashers\nwith transparency, including critical information regarding deliveries upfront such as guaranteed earnings,\nestimated time and distance, merchant name, and consumer drop-off information.\nProprietary technology to optimize Dasher efficiency. We have developed proprietary technology to optimize Dasher\nefficiency, which keeps Dashers busy and increases their earnings potential. Based on forecasted demand, our\nalgorithms predict the ideal number of Dashers needed in a given location at a given time. This helps balance the\nsupply of Dashers with consumer demand and keeps Dashers busy when they are using our local logistics platform.\nAdditionally, our algorithms contribute to a reduction in wasted time on a delivery and the improvement of Dasher\nefficiency in a variety of ways, including through smarter dispatching based on specific order preparation times\nand order batching. These technologies are vital as they improve Dasher efficiency and therefore the amount Dashers\ncan earn and the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform.\nSALES AND MARKETING\nMarketing\nThe strength of our local logistics platform and the benefits that accrue to merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nserve as our most effective marketing tool. This has helped us generate strong organic merchant, consumer, and\nDasher growth through word-of-mouth since our earliest days. We also employ paid marketing efforts to attract and\nretain additional merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nWith merchants, we collaborate on co-marketing campaigns to promote our local logistics platform through their in-\nstore collateral,television campaigns, and other digital marketing efforts. In addition, we will also co-create\nnational and regional promotional campaigns with partner merchants that drive consumer demand to our Marketplace\nand generate significant press coverage—which in turn increases brand affinity and keeps both us and our partner\nmerchants top of mind with consumers.\nWe employ referral campaigns as well as online and offline marketing channels to attract new consumers and Dashers\nto our local logistics platform. Our online and offline channels include search engine marketing, display\nadvertising, social media, streaming audio,direct mail, television, and billboards. When we acquire a new consumer\nor Dasher, we often provide promotions or incentives to demonstrate our value proposition to them early on in their\nlife cycle.\nSales\nWe utilize both inside sales and field sales teams to grow our merchant base in the United States, Canada, and\nAustralia. A growing portion of our merchant acquisition funnel is also self-serve. Through our self-serve channel,\nmerchants can sign up and onboard directly via our website.\nOur account management team supports our sales efforts. This team onboards merchants, drives adoption of our new\nofferings and services, such as DashPass, Drive, or Pickup, based on a merchant’s evolving business needs, and\noptimizes logistics operations. Our account management team is responsible for ensuring the continued success of\nmerchants on our local logistics platform.\nHUMAN CAPITAL AND EMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 3,886 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our\nemployees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our\nemployee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\n11\nTable o f Contents\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ncities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the\ntalent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the\nvoices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources,\nand opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company.\nThe year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership\nteam, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nWomen’s Leadership Forum\nOur Women’s Leadership Forum equips mid- to senior-level technical women with skills to thrive in our workplace.\nThis six-month program happens once a year and includes classroom-style learning, one-on-one coaching, and group\nroundtables. Members of our management team actively participate in the forum.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (ERGs), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have six ERGs: Hue (employees of color), Black@DoorDash, Latinx@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash\n(LGBTQIA+), and Parents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nSMASH\nWe partner with the non-profit, SMASH, to host underrepresented college and college-bound students in STEM\n(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) during the summer. The students work closely with our\nengineering and product teams to develop and present solutions to various product design challenges.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale\nof our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that\nenable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors. We believe that we are positioned favorably\nbecause we provide consumers with convenient access to our unmatched combination of merchant selection, experience,\nand value.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors including flexibility and earnings\npotential. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the density of our network, the improving\nefficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nIn the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Grubhub\n(pending acquisition by Just Eat Takeaway), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that\nhave their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems such as Toast\nand ChowNow, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery\nservices, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to\nexpand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In\naddition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper\nmenus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to\nattract consumers. With Drive, and as we\n12\nTable o f Contents\ncontinue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies\nwith substantial resources, users and brand power, such as Amazon and Google.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution\nhave allowed us to quickly extend our network and our geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to\nexpand within our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information\nabout the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nBusiness and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.”\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2020, we had 25 issued U.S. patents, 41 U.S. patent applications pending, and 14 patent applications pending in a\nforeign jurisdiction. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of\nnew intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2020, we held 34 registered trademarks in the United States and\n48 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered\ndomain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws,\nregulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees,\nanti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product\nliability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property,\nconsumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and\ncollective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application\nand website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our\nplatform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, tobacco,\ncannabidiol, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate\ntransport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due\nto their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time\nthrough judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.\nSee the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and\nRegulatory Environment—If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and\nRegulatory Environment—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, many of which are\nunsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or\notherwise\n13\nTable o f Contents\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to\nOur Dependence on Third Parties—We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by\nconsumers and payments made to merchants and Dashers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third\nparty and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected,” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to\nour business associated with such laws and regulations.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated in 2013 as Palo Alto Delivery Inc., a Delaware corporation.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply with Proposition 22\nin the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely\naffected;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and any failure by them to maintain their\nservice levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and the\ncosts of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue,\nTotal Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline\nas a result of a widespread COVID-19 vaccine rollout;\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional\nmaterial weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may\nresult in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic\nreporting obligations;\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;\nand\n15\nTable o f Contents\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy, or the Voting\nAgreement, between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang, or our Co-Founders, has the effect of concentrating voting\npower with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will limit\nyour ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election\nof our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the\napproval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate\ntransaction. Future issuances of our Class C common stock, if any, will not dilute the voting control of Mr. Xu,\nbut will dilute his economic interest which could cause his interests to conflict with your interests. Further, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock, whether to Mr. Xu or to other stockholders, could prolong the duration\nof Mr. Xu’s voting control.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased\nusage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\nhire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future.\nAlthough we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net\nlosses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $204 million, $667 million, and $461\nmillion in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2019, and 2020,\nwe had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase\nover time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our\nbusiness and operating as a public company. We\n16\nTable o f Contents\nhave expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our\nplatform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services,\nexpanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be\nmore costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Any failure to\nincrease our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from\nmaintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, we\nhave $1.1 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity\nawards. Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs. For more information, see “—We have\nexpended and intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy a portion of our tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise in connection with the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs, which may have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” in\nwhich shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our\nstockholders.”\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate and financial\nperformance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the years ended December 31, 2018,\n2019 and 2020, our revenue was $291 million, $885 million, and $2.9 billion, respectively, representing a 204% and\n226% year-over-year growth rate, respectively. In addition, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a\nsignificant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances that have accelerated the\ngrowth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a\nwidespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth\nrates to decline in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous\nquarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business\nmetrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods. We expect\nour revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and decline in the long term. Our revenue\ngrowth rate may decline in future periods as the size of our business grows and as we achieve higher market\nadoption rates. We may also experience declines in our revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors,\nincluding slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nthat utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to\ncontinue to capitalize on growth opportunities, increasing regulatory costs, and the maturation of our business,\namong others. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business,\nwhich may not result in increased revenue or growth. In addition, we have strategically focused on suburban markets\nand smaller metropolitan areas since our founding because of the opportunity that these markets have presented for\nour local logistics platform. If the demand for local logistics platforms does not continue to grow in these\nmarkets, or if we are unable to maintain our category share in these markets, our revenue growth rate could be\nadversely affected. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United\nStates, we compete with other local food delivery logistics companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (pending\nacquisition by Just Eat Takeaway), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have\ntheir own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems such as Toast and\nChowNow, other merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and\ncompanies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our\npresence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we\ncompete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that\nmerchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local\n17\nTable o f Contents\npublications to attract consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult, and if merchants and\nconsumers do not embrace the transition to local food delivery logistics as we expect, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial\nresources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or\nemerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less\nattractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic\nmarket, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and\nsupply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less\nappealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic\nrelationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in\nDecember 2020, Just Eat Takeaway, a European local logistics platform, announced that it has entered into a\ndefinitive agreement to acquire Grubhub, and Lyft announced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft’s loyalty-\nprogram members free delivery from Grubhub restaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired\nkitchens to enable them to produce and deliver food directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new\nofferings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns\nthan ours. Additionally, many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant\ncommission rates and consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and\nconsumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be\nmore attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our\ncommission rates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain\ncompetitive, particularly in markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively\naffected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such\nefforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a\nwide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly\ncapitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our\ncompetitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they\noffer, and compete more effectively against us. Delivery logistics services for food and the other verticals in\nwhich we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that\nwill allow us to maintain or increase profitability. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may\ncompete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and\nGoogle. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost-effective to develop their own platforms to offer\nonline pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIn addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift\nto the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local logistics platform, independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local logistics platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may\nadopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more\nhighly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our\nplatform. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from\nthe use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown\nin the past. In\n18\nTable o f Contents\nparticular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide selection for\nconsumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect to\ncontinue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations\ninto new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive\nenvironments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will\nnot be achieved for several years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers\nwe acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may generally\nterminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do\nnot generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with\nus, the merchant selection available on our local logistics platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our\nbusiness and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain\nother constituencies For example, the increased growth of our subscription product, DashPass, and how compelling\nthis offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass. Additionally, many\nof our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other\nreduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby\nencouraging them to access our platform regularly or subscribe as a paid user of DashPass, through prompts and\nnotifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may never convert\nto a paid subscription to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are\nnot able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying consumers,\ndemand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or\ndecline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for\norders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, and access to Dasher Experience Centers where Dashers can\nreceive assistance with pressing issues, meet other Dashers, and participate in special events. If we do not\ncontinue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other\nincentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform. For example, if merchants and consumers choose to\nuse competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived\nutility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We also frequently test Dasher\nincentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and\nretain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse\nconsequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment\nlaws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or\nhigher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of\ngasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our\nplatform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in effect until terminated by Dashers or us.\nDashers may generally terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven days advance\n19\nTable o f Contents\nnotice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers or retain existing\nDashers on favorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, or if Dashers\nterminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased\noperating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods\nto our consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand,\nproducing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience\nproblems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an\nincrease in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission\nrates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if\nmerchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide\nconsumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform.\nMany of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the\ncontrol of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit\ncosts, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on\nour platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some merchants choose to charge higher prices on our platform\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between Marketplace and Drive;\nthe proportion of consumers that subscribe to DashPass;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, particularly with respect to local food delivery logistics, including the effect\nof academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n20\nTable o f Contents\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;\nour ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;\nthe effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\nthe effect the widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has on consumer behavior and our order volumes;\nthe impact that price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and\nany associated increase in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems\nare not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our\nbusiness interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions\nin our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nsystem failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as\na result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted.\nThese events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures\nin the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided\ncredits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar\nevent, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the\navailability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and\ncould result in the loss of users.\n21\nTable o f Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as a\nresult of a successful COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel,\nand widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business\nwill depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including:\nnew information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;\nthe duration and spread of the outbreak;\nthe severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary\nbusiness closures;\nregulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant\npricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;\nother business disruptions that affect our workforce;\nthe availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;\nthe continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;\nthe impact on capital and financial markets; and\nactions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or\ntreat its impact.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken active measures to promote health and safety, including\nproviding for no-contact delivery, distributing masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to Dashers in affected areas, and\nworking closely with merchants to share safety guidelines. However, our efforts may not be successful and we may\nnot have sufficient protection or recovery plans to continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public\nhealth threats in the future. In connection with public health threats, we may also be required to temporarily\nclose our corporate offices and have our employees work remotely, as we have done in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, which impacts productivity and otherwise disrupts our business operations. In addition, the current\noutbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and\nfinancial markets, and similar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and\ncould in the future impact, demand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely\naffect our revenue and results of operations.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace\nGOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery\nand take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform. The circumstances that have accelerated the\ngrowth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a\nwidespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth\nrates to decline in future periods.\nFurthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our\nemployees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any\ncontact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact\nmerchants’ ability to operate their businesses, consumers’ ability to pick up orders, and Dashers’ ability to make\ndeliveries during certain times, or at all. Further, demand from businesses that typically place large orders for\ntheir employees or in-person meetings may be significantly reduced. With the COVID-19 pandemic, our DoorDash for\nWork offering has been limited to providing large group orders solely to businesses that are deemed essential and\nwe have also temporarily paused catering orders. Such events have in the past caused, and may in the future cause,\na temporary closure of merchants’ businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary preventative measures,\nand many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their businesses, and may be\nforced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their businesses, many may operate\nwith limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or disruptions or closures of\nmerchants’ businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our ability to operate our\nlocal logistics platform, and adversely affect our business.\n22\nTable o f Contents\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived\nrisk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as\nunsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our\nplatform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar\npublic health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform\nwould be adversely affected. Any negative impact on consumers’ willingness or ability to order delivery or complete\na Pickup order, or on Dashers’ willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely\nto also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms will\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, jurisdictions across the United States, including Washington, Massachusetts, jurisdictions within Los\nAngeles County, California, San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, have implemented\ntemporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative proposals\nto make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be\nmade. While several jurisdictions initially proposed permanent price controls but then implemented temporary price\ncontrols, other jurisdictions may implement permanent price controls in the future . These price controls have had\nin the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price\ncontrols have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we\nare aware of two jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against doing so in connection\nwith price controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced demand for our services\nby consumers. With the continued duration of COVID-19, we expect these existing price controls to persist in the\nnear term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these\nevents occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or\naction may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates\nadditional challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer,\nlower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that\nenable them to attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no\nassurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of\ndelivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further reduce the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and may in the future\nlaunch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription products like DashPass, and Dasher or consumer\nloyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies, any of which may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers. Further, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by\ngeographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these\nlocations. In particular, our continued international expansion may require us to change our pricing strategies and\nto adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing and gratuities. While we do and\nwill attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant, consumer, and Dasher feedback and\nengagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing\nand we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the services on our platform change, then\nwe may need to revise our pricing methodologies.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.\nOur pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former\nDasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little\nor no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile,\nit also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being\nreceived by Dashers. Government authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay\nmodel and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed\nan action in the Superior\n23\nTable o f Contents\nCourt of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures\nAct with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and\njudgment to resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former Dasher pay model from other\ngovernment authorities in the future.\nThe incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to\nsome consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are\nable to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the\nfuture launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher\npay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and\ndesirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers\nwho meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and\npromotions. The base pay amount, any promotions, and any tips that the consumer chooses to include at checkout are\nshown to Dashers when they are offered a delivery.\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current\nDasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay\nmodel may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in\nearnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of\nfactors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any\nfuture changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an\nincrease to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been\ninvolved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc. v. Superior Court , or Dynamex, including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June\n2020. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test\nset forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which\nwas signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5\ncodified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous\ncarve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative, or\nProposition 22, to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020\nand went into effect in December 2020. Under Proposition 22, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with\ncertain other requirements, are now applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs related to Dashers\nhave increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we will in certain circumstances charge\nhigher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time and adversely impact our results\nof operations. In addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation\nthat would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in\nongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work\nthat Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related\nto Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if\nwe charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and our results of operations would be adversely\nimpacted. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could\nstill be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, on January 12, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed a writ\npetition with the Supreme Court of California challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22. On February 3,\n2021, the Court denied the writ petition without prejudice, but on February 11, 2021, plaintiffs re-filed their\nclaim in California Superior Court and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we could face further\nchallenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors as other states\nwhere we operate are considering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of Dashers or\ndelivery service providers using a local logistics platform as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other substantive\ninternal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an employment position, which would have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\n24\nTable o f Contents\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our\ngoals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term.\nThese decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the\nlong-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example,\nEmployee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the\nUnited States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on\nmanagement and our operational and financial infrastructure. For example, in connection with the audit of our\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in\nour consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could\ncause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and\nfinancial infrastructure in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of\noperations.\nAs with many companies in our growth stage, a majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than 24 months.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and\nfinancial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new\nemployees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to\ndevelop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and\nprocedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if\nwe do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the\nefficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing\nour reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our\nmarketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to\nsuccessfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” mark, our logo, and other trademarks\nimportant to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe\nthat our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives\nnew consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our\nconsumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local logistics platforms and\nservices, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal\nto new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local logistics\nplatforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative\nperception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a\nresult of:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and\nguidelines, including Dasher pay;\n25\nTable o f Contents\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay\nmodel, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security\npractices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely\naffect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and\nloyalty of merchants, consumers, and\n26\nTable o f Contents\nDashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers\nwere compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food\nsafety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and merchants using our platform, which\nhas adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of our\nbrand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our\nreputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or influencers that we have partnered\nwith may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we\nmay receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand, and adversely affect\nour reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ninformation relating to our business, such as our own proprietary information and personal data relating to our\nemployees. An increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses,\nother large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of\ntheir information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved\nsophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors’ platforms,\nvendors' systems, or with our vendors’ personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website and\nplatforms. We have previously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in September\n2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain\nDashers’ driver licenses as well as data related to certain of our consumers. This incident has resulted in\nregulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this incident has not resulted in a material loss\nof revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and\ngovernance program, which include adding additional protective security layers around the data, improving security\nprotocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside expertise to increase our ability to identify\nand repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and\nremediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help\nprovide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover\ncosts and liabilities related to this incident.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a\ntimely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we may face delays in our detection or remediation\nof, or other responses to, security breaches and other privacy- and security-related incidents. Unauthorized\nparties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities used in our\nbusiness through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our employees,\nmerchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information,\nor other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology, or IT, systems, or\nattempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment information,\nresulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors.\nIn addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to\nour systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are\nbecoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to\nidentify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve\ncredential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored\nor supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect,\nremediate, and otherwise respond to.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other\nsecurity breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past\nand cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to\ncyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access data, including personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, our employees’ personal data, or our other\nsensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those systems. Employee error, malfeasance, or other errors in\nthe storage, use, or transmission of any of these types of data could result in an actual or perceived privacy or\nsecurity breach or other\n27\nTable o f Contents\nsecurity incident. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal information we store, there is\na risk that these policies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any\nactual or perceived security breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform\nbeing unavailable, result in loss or improper access to, or acquisition or disclosure of, data, result in\nfraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our relationships with\nthird-party partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and significant legal,\nregulatory, and financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such incidents or any\nperception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence\nin, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting\nany entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers)\ncould have similar effects. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security and privacy breaches and\nother incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole\nand, as a result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and\nprevent privacy and security breaches and other privacy- and security-related incidents, and we may face increased\ncosts and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security\nbreach or other incident.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their\nmerit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be\nadequate for data handling or data security costs or liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to\nbe available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any\nfuture claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance\ncoverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of\nlarge deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for local food delivery logistics and our other delivery logistics services are still in relatively\nearly stages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow\nas large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe local food delivery logistics market has grown rapidly since we launched our local logistics platform in 2013,\nbut it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at\nall. In addition, the market for the other delivery logistics services we facilitate, such as grocery delivery\nservices, is also relatively nascent, and it is uncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other\ndelivery logistics services we may facilitate in the future will continue to grow and achieve wide market\nacceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt\nlocal food delivery logistics and the other delivery logistics services we facilitate. If the public does not\nperceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding safety,\naffordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform\nmay not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the\nactivities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which\ncould adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery,\ntheft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering\nDasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such\nactivities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees relating to payments on our platform, attempted payments by consumers with\ninsufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers of Dasher accounts\nby bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal\ninformation, such as unauthorized\n28\nTable o f Contents\nuse of another person’s identity, account information, or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use\nof credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone numbers. For example, bad actors have\ncreated Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying information to commit fraud on our\nplatform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to\nindividuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have launched a series of initiatives and products\nchanges to help prevent this practice.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nactivities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through\nlitigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated\nfrom our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At\nthe same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and\ninadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable\nto implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the\ngrowth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be\nadversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal,\nimproper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which\nenables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are\nretained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in\nany of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Further,\nany negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our\ncompetitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a\nwhole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory\nor litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers\nfrom non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally\nefficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants’\nsystems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does\nnot require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and\npay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each\norder, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we\nsometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that\noccur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated\nwith facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and\ncause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner\nmerchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed.\nWhile we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their\ninclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair\ncompetition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is\nalso a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the\nplatform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149, or AB 2149,\nwhich was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits,\namong other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California\nwithout the restaurants’ prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in Louisiana, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, Denver, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizona and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond\nregulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries\nfrom merchants without their prior consent. For example, in November 2020, we\n29\nTable o f Contents\nadopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our\nplatform in the United States and such policies require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nDoorDash. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may continue to\nrevise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we\nare required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsite and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely\naffected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our\nfuture success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and\nupfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively,\nor we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced\nplatform features and services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our\nexpectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in\nfavor of those of our competitors.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third-parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability\nto scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\n30\nTable o f Contents\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local logistics platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our local logistics platform and\nwhile we continue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology,\nincluding enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our\nrouting and batching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the\nresulting gains in efficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the\ncost of our business and subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost\neffectiveness of our local logistics platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological\nimprovements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and\ncredits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform, including\nwith respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our\ngrowth and expenses. We generally experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year,\nalthough our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement\nweather, which typically increases consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which typically decreases consumer\ndemand. In addition, the number of available Dashers generally decreases during periods of inclement weather, but\nconsumer demand during these times requires us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these\ntimes, we rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which\nincreases our costs. Further, severe weather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to\nclose, and make it impossible for Dashers to make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In\naddition, we benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience\na decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods,\ncausing a similar decrease in Dasher pay. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a\nquarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience\nmay become more pronounced and contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and\nour growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending\nand investment plans on forecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if\nour revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the\nexpectations of investors.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending, may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the\nfactors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment,\nconsumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices,\ninterest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items\ngenerally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,\nwildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like some of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or\npermanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform. This risk is particularly\npronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in\nmarkets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for purchases from many of the merchants on\nour platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that any decline in consumer spending would\nhave a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses that sell products or services\nconsidered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines, consumers may be less likely\nto use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n31\nTable o f Contents\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior\noperating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer\npreferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory\ndynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the\npool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new\nDashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our\nability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and\nretain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business\nmetrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in\nthe local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are\nunable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to\nadditional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. We launched our platform in Canada in 2015 and in Australia\nin 2019, and we expect to expand our international operations. Operating outside of the United States may require\nsignificant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and\ncustoms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations\nteams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a\nvariety of reasons, including:\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture\nacross all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data\nprivacy, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may increase\nour risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery,\nexport controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\nIf we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or\nfail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected,\nchange our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than\nthose of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n32\nTable o f Contents\nWe believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our\nindustry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous\nand drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies.\nWhile we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of\nsuch technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners’ autonomous or drone\ndelivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory\nscrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and\nprospects. Even if our or our partners’ efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are\nsuccessful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our\ncurrent costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and\nAmazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through\ncollaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local logistics\nindustry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale before we or\nour partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before we do, or\ntheir technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may be able to leverage\nsuch technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery logistics services, these competitors could\noffer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a\nsignificant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous\nand drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the\ncommercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our\nplatform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these\ntechnologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners’ ability to design and manufacture new\nautonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote\npilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature\ncontinue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing\nor new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial\nfines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,\nincluding acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that\ncomplement our business. For exa mple, in October 2019, we acquired certain assets and liabilities from Square,\nInc. related to Caviar, a marketplace focused on facilitating deliveries from p remium restaurants. We have\npreviously acquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result,\nthere is no assurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate\nsubstantial revenue.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our\nability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired\ncompany;\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\ndifficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired\ncompany;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition\nopportunities;\n33\nTable o f Contents\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or\ntechnology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue\nrecognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired\ncompany or business;\nrisks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail\nto successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees may receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their\nmotivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and\nretain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train, and integrate such\nemployees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring\nneeds or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale,\nproductivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\n34\nTable o f Contents\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We\nmay operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify\nadditional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal\ncontrols, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail\nto meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nIn recent periods, we have experienced rapid growth, and this growth has placed considerable strain on our IT and\naccounting systems, processes, and personnel. As a result, in connection with the audit of our consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered\npublic accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material\nweakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness that we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified occurred because (i)\nwe had inadequate processes and controls to ensure an appropriate level of precision related to our revenue to cash\nreconciliation process, and (ii) we did not have sufficient resources with the adequate technical skills to meet\nthe emerging needs of our financial reporting requirements.\nWhile we believe this material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we\nhave identified all of our existing material weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material\nweaknesses. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result\nin errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements,\nand could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us\nand cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and\nregulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of\nthese rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make\nsome activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems,\nand resources.\n35\nTable o f Contents\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for\nthe years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address this material weakness, we hired\nadditional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence personnel and implemented process level and\nmanagement review controls to identify and address emerging risks. While we believe this material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material\nweaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any\ndifficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to\nfail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior\nperiods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting\nfirm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will\neventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence\nin our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of\nour Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able\nto remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that\nimplement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we are\nrequired to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting until the year ending December 31, 2021. At such time, our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the\nlevel at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to\nmaintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect\non our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\noverwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not\nreturn to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that\nwe do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our\ntechnology and network architecture to accommodate actual and\n36\nTable o f Contents\nanticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and\naccess or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in\nexposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We\nmay need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any\nsuch errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have expended and intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy a portion of our tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise in connection with the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs, which may have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” in\nwhich shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have expended and intend to expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise upon the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs. Certain of our RSUs vested upon\nthe effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement (the “IPO Vested RSUs”) and will settle approximately 180 days\nfollowing the effective date of our IPO Registration Statement under their terms (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement\nDate”). Under U.S. tax laws, the employment tax withholding and remittance obligations for the IPO Vested RSUs\narose in connection with their vesting, and the income tax withholding and remittance obligations will arise in\nconnection with their settlement on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date. On the initial vesting date for the IPO\nVested RSUs, we withheld shares and remitted tax withholding amounts on behalf of the holders of IPO Vested RSUs at\nthe applicable statutory rates for those IPO Vested RSU holders who elect to net share settle these tax withholding\nobligations, for which we expended approximately $7 million to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations.\nCertain IPO Vested RSU holders elected to receive a short-term loan from us, with interest that will accrue at the\napplicable federal rate to settle the tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of the IPO\nVested RSUs on the effectiveness of our IPO registration statement. The short-term loan extended to employees\ntotaled $10 million as of December 31, 2020. The balance of the loan is repayable from the proceeds of sale of\nshares into the market on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date, which will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs (including the income tax withholding and remittance obligations due with respect to the IPO\nVested RSUs on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date), we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock\nthat would otherwise be issued with respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may\ninclude cash generated from the proceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations or (ii) have the holders of\nsuch RSUs use a broker or brokers to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement\ndate, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for us to remit to the relevant taxing authorities, in\norder to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such\nRSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common\nstock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates\non behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash, which would result in significant cash\nexpenditures by us. If we implement “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, shares with a market\nvalue equivalent to the tax withholding obligation will be sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting\nand settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales will be remitted by us\nto the taxing authorities. Such sales will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the\ntax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders.\n37\nTable o f Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-\nGAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools that\nare not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published\nby third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal\nsystems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over\ntime, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the\ninternal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic\nor other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe\nto be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges\nin measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics\ncould be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have\nmultiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and\nprevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our\nplatform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that\nwe measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term\nstrategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive\nour operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we\nexpect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations would be adversely affected.\n38\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification\nof Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an\nindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and\nregulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and\ndivergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. As\nreferenced above, we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers\nmay be reclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider\nclassification and their potential impact on the local logistics industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other\ndelivery service providers as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations, including as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as\nemployees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability\nto add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as\nindependent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have\nbarred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this\ncase. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn on December 8, 2020. We believe we have meritorious\ndefenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In\naddition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis including claims raised\nunder PAGA and are in the process of settling a similar classification matter in California. See the section titled\n“Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\nAn increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in\nDynamex to determine worker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into\nlaw by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the\nDynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs.\nWe, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative, or\nProposition 22, to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. As such,\ncertain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and\nDashers in California and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these\nincreased costs, we will in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower\norder volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these\nincreased costs could also lead to a lower Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace\nGOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us include, but are not limited to,\n(i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings\nfloor equal to (a) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (b) for\n39\nTable o f Contents\nDashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation after 2021) and\n(ii) for Dashers averaging at least 15 hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who subscribe to a\nqualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts depending on a\nDasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an adverse impact on our results of\noperations. In addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation that\nwould pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing\ndiscussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that\nDashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge\nhigher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even\nwith the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be\nchallenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court\nchallenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22 and similar challenges may also be filed. Furthermore, if\nDashers are determined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in even higher\nincreases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions even more\nand may result in further lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under other\nstate or federal law, we would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations, which\nwould have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses\nfor legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our\nbusiness generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims\nrelated to food offerings, delivery, and quality.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal,\nregulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage,\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer\ncomplaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may\nbecome subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and legal or regulatory\nproceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we\nsometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the\nuncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we\nface increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic\nbeverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of,\nany consumers, Dashers, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal\nclaims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the\nfuture as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The\npotential for acts of terrorism on the U.S. or international food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs,\nit could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform could be\nsubject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a food recall. In addition,\nreports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation,\nhandling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, could, as a result of\nnegative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nservice fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background\ncheck process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In\naddition, we also face potential liability\n40\nTable o f Contents\nand expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating to, among other things, our Dasher pay\nmodel, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and\ngratuities, the local food delivery logistics services we facilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our\nwebsite and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from which the food is delivered, including\ndiscrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of\nour marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings”\nfor additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsite and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These\nproceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or\nother orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual\nand other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial\npartners and current and former directors and officers.\nIn addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation\nprocess for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in\nstate or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class\naction waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been\nthe subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may\nlimit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory\nproceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit\ncertain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or\nall of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised\nto exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in\npart, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our\nbusiness or to local logistics businesses generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n41\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Australia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise\nquestions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest,\nand could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us\nto collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a\njurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on\npast sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing\nour offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even\nwhere we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately\ncalculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants try to pass along increased additional\ntaxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we have reserved for potential payments of\npossible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial\ncondition would be harmed.\nUnder state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of\ngoods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,\nor other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past\nsales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our\nplatform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. , certain states have enacted\nlaws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting\nor collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new\nlegislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated\nwith tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less\nattractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, federal tax rules generally require payors to report payments to unrelated parties to the IRS. Under certain\ncircumstances, a failure to comply with such reporting obligations may cause us to become liable to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy\nsuch failures in a timely manner.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses.\nAs we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign\ntaxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes\nand sales taxes are described in\n42\nTable o f Contents\nmore detail under “ —If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.” and “—Taxing authorities may successfully assert\nthat we have not properly collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, gross receipts, value added,\nor similar taxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations,\nor inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”\nOn December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was\nenacted, which contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a\ntransition to a new territorial system of taxation. The primary impact of the new legislation on our provision for\nincome taxes was a reduction of the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in\nthe corporate tax rate. However, since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets,\nthese changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the Tax Act\nwill likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which we will continue to\nmonitor and assess.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated $689 million and $547 million of federal and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards, or NOLs, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to expire\nin 2033 for federal and 2023 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in\ntime to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to\nuse its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may\nbe limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply\nunder state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income and\nliabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that\nmay occur in the future.\nUnder the Tax Act, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, net\noperating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be\ncarried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the tax year of such loss, but net operating losses\narising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back. Additionally, under the Tax\nAct, as modified by the CARES Act, net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 may\noffset no more than 80% of current taxable income annually for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, but\nthe 80% limitation on the use of net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 does not\napply for taxable income in tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. NOLs arising in tax years ending after\nDecember 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but NOLs generated in tax years ending before January 1,\n2018 will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. As we maintain a full\nvaluation allowance against our U.S. NOLs, these changes will not impact our balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nHowever, in future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, the changes in\nthe carryforward and carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our\nvaluation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2019.\nThere is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs and tax credits by\ncertain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help counter the fiscal impact from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs and tax credits\ncould expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. A temporary suspension of the use\nof certain NOLs and tax credits has been enacted in California, and other states may enact suspensions as well. For\nthese reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and tax credits.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and\nfailure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe local delivery logistics industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly\nregulated products, online credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, subscription\nservices, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks,\nwebsite and mobile application accessibility, and tax are\n43\nTable o f Contents\noften complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and\ninterpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting,\nincluding varying standards and interpretations between state and federal law, between individual states, and even\nat the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time\nthrough judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been proactively working with state and local\ngovernments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly in the United States and Canada.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also\nlikely that if our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we\nwould become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing\nlaws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may become subject.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses\nlike ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, jurisdictions across the United States, including Washington, Massachusetts, jurisdictions\nwithin Los Angeles County, California, San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, have\nimplemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative\nproposals to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals\nto be made. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on\nour results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the\nfees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of two jurisdictions which have adopted explicit limits or\nprohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls, which could further increase our costs. With the\ncontinued duration of COVID-19, we expect these existing price controls to persist in the near term and for\nadditional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these events occur, or if\nprice controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or\nconflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates additional challenges to managing our\nbusiness.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our\nbusiness model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their\ntrade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the\nlegal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to\nchange such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the\nability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or\nregulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that\nwe may not be able to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement\nnew measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to\ndiscontinue certain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings,\nfines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement\nactions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative\nproposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred\nto prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n44\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws\nand regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, and other\nanticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government\nofficials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any\nimproper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address\ncompliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of\nour policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating\nthese laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign\njurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money\nlaundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of\nsignificant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment\nfrom U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or\noverall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws\nspecifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce,\nor other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business\npractices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue\nto evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content,\ncopyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts\nand other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and\nquality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and\nother taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to\nexpand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our\nmobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any\nfailure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our\nreputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other data relating to\nthe users on our platform, as well as other personally identifiable information and other data relating to\nindividuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and\nregulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types\nof data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law,\nAustralia’s Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or the TCPA, Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and effective as of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA. These laws,\nrules, and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation,\namendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to\nanother. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires new\ndisclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of\npersonal information. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation. Aspects of the CCPA and its\ninterpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching\n45\nTable o f Contents\nand may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related\ncosts and expenses. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions, and it is unclear whether it will be further\namended. For example, a ballot initiative in California in November 2020 titled the California Privacy Rights Act,\nor CPRA, was approved by California voters and significantly modified the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty\nand likely requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA creates obligations\nrelating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1,\n2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA. The\neffects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing\npractices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, many laws and\nregulations relating to privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain\ntypes of data are subject to varying degrees of enforcement and new and changing interpretations by courts. The\nCCPA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security,\nparticularly any new or modified laws or regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of such laws\nor regulations, that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data\nretention, transfer, or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our platform, require significant\nchanges to our operations, or even prevent us from providing our platform in jurisdictions in which we currently\noperate and in which we may operate in the future.\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with\nprivacy, data protection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry\nstandards, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing\nnew and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application\nof these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making\nnecessary changes to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform\ncould be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or merchants on our platform, to comply with\napplicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information\nsecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally\nidentifiable information or other data relating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that\nany of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and\nexisting Dashers and consumers from using our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by\ngovernmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy\nconcerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities\nor claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text\nmessages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we\nbecome liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued\nAccounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers (Topic 606),” or ASC 606,\nwhich superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” or ASC 842, which increases lease transparency and comparability among\norganizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting\npolicies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\n46\nTable o f Contents\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance\ncoverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability,\nemployment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving\nservices, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services,\nand we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain.\nAdditionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related\nclaims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of\ninsurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of\nthese merchant agreements.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\nretentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles\nfor many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or\nwe may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim,\npremiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we\nexperience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance\nclaims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our\ndeductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by consumers and payments made to\nmerchants and Dashers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related\nrisks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made by consumers and payments\nmade to merchants and Dashers. Under our commercial agreement with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship\nwith advanced notice. If Stripe terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to\nsecure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and\nservices provided by Stripe may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be\ncompromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments\nor other payment transactions or make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our\nbusiness for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely\naffect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nNearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services,\nwhich subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws\nand regulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering,\nmoney transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable\nregulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or\ncriminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other\npayment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely\non data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nFurther, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to\ncertain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and\nnumerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may\nhave a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we\ncould be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial\nservices, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are\nsubject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we\nare not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more\njurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to\n47\nTable o f Contents\nfines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil\nproceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make\nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain\nservices to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment\nprocessor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these\nrules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services,\nor AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the\nfacilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,\ncybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s\ncontinuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and\ncapacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the\nrequirements of users on our platform. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to\nour success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become\nincreasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand\nand the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our\nreputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events\nmay harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-\nterm loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the\nagreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the agreement\nfor cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure\nperiod, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even though our\nplatform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a\nshort period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.\nHowever, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers\nwould cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\n48\nTable o f Contents\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal and/or driving records of potential\nDashers to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our\ninternal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their\ncontractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our\nthird-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with\nus on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure\nsimilar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable timeframe. In certain jurisdictions, including the United\nStates, we rely on a single third-party background check provider for these jurisdictions. If we cannot find\nalternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard\npotential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential Dashers and we may have\ndifficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background checks conducted by our\nthird-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified\nDashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be unable to adequately\nprotect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers may be inadvertently\nexcluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction that should have excluded\nhim from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check providers, and as a result,\nwe allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to cause personal injury to a\nmerchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely\naffected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages\nin criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such\ncriminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our platform. In addition, if\nthe background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet the requirements under\napplicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related\nto notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be\nlimited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail\nto conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of\neligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n49\nTable o f Contents\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all\nmapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping\nfunctions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of\nour third party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its\nrelationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our\nplatform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software\nthat we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software\non terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such\nsoftware, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or\ninferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as\nGoogle Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are\nconstantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with\nthird-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our\nplatform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or\nexert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nAs our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our\ncompetitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that\ndegrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such\napplication marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce\nthe effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial\nresults, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any\nchanges in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ applications could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile\ndevices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our\napplications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our\napplications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify\ntheir search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such\nmobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our\nuser growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar\nfluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will\ncontinue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to\ndeliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range\nof mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers,\nor Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile\ndevices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth\nand user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple announced its plans to make\ncertain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating\nsystem. We expect that these\n50\nTable o f Contents\nchanges will negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will limit our\nvisibility into the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these\ndevelopments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from existing\nconsumers on our platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in\nsearch results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is\ndue in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search\nengine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced\nfluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any\nreduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-\nparty sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources\nor the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our\nability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade\nname or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad\n51\nTable o f Contents\nmay be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope\nof the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our\ntrademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our\nproprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFor example, in 2020 we received a letter from International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, alleging that\nwe infringe on at least five U.S. patents held by IBM, and inviting us to negotiate a business resolution of the\nallegations. To date, no litigation has been filed by IBM against us regarding the IBM patents. Based upon our\npreliminary review of these patents, we believe we have meritorious defenses to IBM’s allegations, although there\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business\nresolution that is satisfactory to us.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at\n52\nTable o f Contents\nlittle or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software\nwith open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release\nthe source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license. This could enable\nour competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a\nloss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the affected portions of our source\ncode, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and resources to re-engineer\nsome or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately\naddress the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital\nand capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, we may require additional financing. Accordingly, we\nmay need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders\ncould suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsuperior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time,\nand our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,\nand operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be\nable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our\nbusiness growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be\n53\nTable o f Contents\naccelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell\nsufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of\noperations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially\nreasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding\nunder the revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our\nassets, or other major corporate transaction.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2020, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,\nand a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of\nour board of directors collectively held 69% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate,\nwhich voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards\n(including in connection with the Equity Award Exchange). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders\n(including the CEO Performance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock\nas of December 31, 2020, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 79% of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock. Our Co-Founders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and\nirrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang,\nand their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted\nupon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring\nthe approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in our Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself\nor the Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to\nherein as the 35% Ownership Threshold; (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Xu,\nduring which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person\ndesignated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person, then our secretary then\nin office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days\nfollowing the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation): or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180\ndays following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or\nconsultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary\nresignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to\nbe renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation occurs as the Final Conversion Date.\n54\nTable o f Contents\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no\nvoting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution,\nwhich would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to\nMr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class\nC common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met.\nAs a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our\nvoting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted\nto a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and,\nin that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their\nholdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will\nnot be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock\nExchange.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders, our Co-\nFounders collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020,\nand Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common\nstock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his\ndiscretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as\nthat term is set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a\ncompany in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or\nanother company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New\nYork Stock Exchange regarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\ncounsel, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture issuances of our Class C common stock, if any, will not dilute the voting control of Mr. Xu, but will dilute\nhis economic interest which could cause his interests to conflict with your interests. Further, the issuance of\nshares of Class C common stock, whether to Mr. Xu or to other stockholders, could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\nvoting control.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the\n55\nTable o f Contents\ncompany’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer\nadmit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices include the Russell\n2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in\n2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-\nclass structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices and in October 2018,\nMSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to\nlaunch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under such announced\npolicies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and,\nas a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices\nwould not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if\nany, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible\nthat they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of\ninvestment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices\nwould likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to\nother investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\n56\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nA substantial portion of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are restricted\nfrom immediate resale, but may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future. The large number of shares eligible\nfor public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price\nof our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market in the near future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur executive officers, directors, and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock and securities\nconvertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock have entered into market standoff agreements with us or have\nentered into lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our IPO under which they have agreed, subject to specific\nexceptions, not to sell any of our stock for a period of time up to 180 days following the date of our final\nprospectus relating to our IPO, dated December 8, 2020 and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act,\nor our Prospectus. We refer to such period as the lock-up period.\nOur lock-up period has two potential release dates, the first following our first earnings release or periodic\nreport (either our quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K), which was determined to be March\n9, 2021, as described below, and the second following our second earnings release or periodic report, or 180 days,\nwhichever is earlier.\nOn March 1, 2021 the underwriters of our IPO agreed that the restricted period under the lock-up agreement will end\nwith respect to 40% of the shares subject to each lock-up agreement (or 20% of the shares if the stockholder is a\nmember of the Company’s board of directors (excluding affiliated funds) or management team) and become eligible for\nsale in the public market at the open of trading on March 9, 2021 (the \"Early Lock-Up Expiration Date\").\nAll remaining shares of common stock subject to the lock-up agreement and not released on the Early Lock-Up\nExpiration Date will be released upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the opening of trading on the third\nfull trading day after we have publicly furnished our second earnings release on Form 8-K or filed our second\nperiodic report with the SEC or (ii) 180 days after the Effective Date, or the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date. We\nwill announce the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date through a press release or Form 8-K at least two full trading days\nbefore it is effective. We and the underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market standoff\nagreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up period.\nSales of our Class A common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult\nfor us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could\nalso cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares\nof our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n57\nTable o f Contents\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, or the Voting\nThreshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first\nrecommended or approved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, our President, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Nothing in our\namended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such\nclaims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and\n58\nTable o f Contents\nrestated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment."

                "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe, including Caviar and our other subsidiaries, are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in,\nlegal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal\nProceedings”) in the ordinary course of business, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, Caviar delivery\nproviders, or other third parties (individually or as class actions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government\ninvestigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging\nthe classification of third-party delivery providers on our platform and on the Caviar platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\n59\nTable o f Contents\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA, and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of third-party delivery providers on our platform and on the Caviar platform as independent\ncontractors.\nIn December 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed\ncertain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging\nworker misclassification of Dashers, or the Marciano settlement. These actions were filed by and on behalf of\nMassachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco on November 21, 2019. On April 24, 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues\nwith the filed settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. On June 8, 2020, the\nparties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. The amended settlement\nagreement increased the total amount to be paid by us from $40 million to $41 million. On June 19, 2020, the court\nissued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed amended settlement agreement and requesting\nsupplemental briefing from the parties. On July 24, 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an\namended settlement agreement to the court. On August 31, 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling denying\nplaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice and inviting the parties to\nfile supplemental briefing addressing the concerns raised by the court. On October 30, 2020, we entered into an\namended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the company from $41 million to $89\nmillion. On November 4, 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and the amended settlement agreement to\nthe court. On February 17, 2021, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for preliminary\napproval of the amended settlement without prejudice. A hearing on the motion is set for March 22, 2021. If the\namended settlement ultimately receives final approval from the court, we expect that this would resolve claims\nunder PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016\nthrough December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period\nof September 26, 2014 through December 31, 2020. Although the settlement only involves claimants in certain\nactions, any final settlement would be on a class basis and would encompass claims by all Dashers in California and\nMassachusetts for the period noted in the previous sentence. Dashers that are members of the class purported to be\ncovered by the settlement could elect to opt out of such settlement, and therefore could bring claims against us\nseparately.\nMore than 35,000 Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have\nfiled or expressed an intention to file arbitration demands against us that assert worker misclassification claims.\nAs of August 17, 2020, we have reached agreements that would resolve the worker misclassification claims of a large\nmajority of these individuals. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible\nfor settlement payments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual\nsettlement agreements. We anticipate that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers\nunder these individual settlement agreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $85 million. We do\nnot admit any allegations of wrongdoing as part of the resolution of these matters.\nVarious other Dashers and Caviar delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge\nin the future, their classification on the DoorDash platform and on the Caviar platform, respectively, as an\nindependent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently\ninvolved in an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney and in a number of such actions filed by\nindividual Dashers and Caviar delivery providers, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought\nin, or compelled pursuant to our Independent Contractor Agreement to, individual arbitration. This action brought\nby the San Francisco District Attorney is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would\nbar us from continuing to classify Dashers as independent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also\nsought a preliminary injunction that would have barred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as\nindependent contractors during the pendency of this case. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn\non December 8, 2020.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States, Canada, and Australia. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law on September\n18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve\nflexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. In addition, several other states where we operate may be\nconsidering adopting legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we would expect to increase our costs related to\nDashers in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if we charge higher fees and commissions as a\nresult of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of\nProposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have\n60\nTable o f Contents\nbeen and may in the future be challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, an increasing number of\njurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\nWe believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of\ndefense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and other\nfactors.\nConsumer Protection and Other Actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, and other laws. In addition, we have been\nsubject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and our Dasher pay model. We\ndispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual Property Matters\nFrom time to time, we are involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other\nintellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive correspondence from other purported\nholders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or asserting infringement\nof such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these\nmatters.\nRegulatory and Administrative Investigations, Audits, and Inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers and Caviar delivery providers, our Dasher pay\nmodel, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental action are inherently\nunpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a material\nimpact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an\ninvestigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action.\nRegardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with\ncooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal Injury Matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on the DoorDash platform or Caviar delivery providers who have been active on the Caviar platform. We\nare currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers\nthat utilize the DoorDash platform, Caviar delivery providers on the Caviar platform, and third parties. In many of\nthese matters, we believe we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or\nincidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and\nlegal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an\nadverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of\nmanagement resources, and other factors."

The actual number of\nstockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but\nwhose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 14 holders of record of our Class B common stock. All shares of our Class B\ncommon stock are beneficially owned by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, or Stanley Tang.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were no holders of our Class C common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available\nfunds and future earnings and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe may enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to\ndeclare or pay cash dividends or make distributions on our capital stock. Any future determination regarding the\ndeclaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-\nexisting conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital\nrequirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nPerformance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of\nSection 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed\nto be incorporated by reference into any filing of DoorDash Inc. under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act.\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return to stockholders on our Class A common stock with the\ncumulative total returns of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, or the S&P 500, and the S&P 500 Information Technology\nSector Index. An investment of $100 is assumed to have been made in our Class A common stock and in each index on\nDecember 9, 2020, the date our Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and its relative\nperformance is tracked through December 31, 2020. The graph uses the closing market price on December 9, 2020 of\n$189.51 per share as the initial value of our Class A common stock.\nThe returns shown are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.\n62\nTable o f Contents\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nPreferred Stock Issuances\nIn June 2020, we sold an aggregate of 8,321,395 shares of our Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock to\nten accredited investors at a purchase price of $45.9062 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of\n$382,003,624.\nOption and RSU Issuances\nFrom January 1, 2020 through December 9, 2020 (the date of the filing of our registration statement on Form S-8),\nwe granted to our directors, officers, employees, consultants and other service providers an aggregate of\n18,833,595 restricted stock units to be settled in shares of our Class A common stock under our 2014 Stock Plan. No\noptions was granted under our 2014 Stock Plan in the same period of time.\nWarrants\nIn November 2020, a warrant to purchase 105,330 shares of our Class A common stock was exercised at an exercise\nprice of $1.492 per share, for an aggregate exercise price of $157,153.\nConvertible Note Issuances\nIn February 2020, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $340 million to four accredited\ninvestors. In February 2021, we paid to the convertible note holders an aggregate of $375 million in cash as\nrepayment and settlement of all principal and interest due under the convertible notes, and the convertible notes\nare no longer outstanding.\nNone of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public\noffering. We believe the offers, sales, and issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under\nthe Securities Act (or Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder) by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the\nSecurities Act because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering, or in\nreliance on Rule 701 because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to\ncompensation as provided under such rule. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions\nrepresented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in\nconnection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in\nthese transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about\nus. The sales of these securities were made without any general solicitation or advertising.\n63\nTable o f Contents\nUse of Proceeds\nOn December 11, 2020, we closed our IPO, in which we sold 33 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price\nof $102.00 per share. All of the shares issued and sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act\npursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-250056), which was declared effective by the SEC on\nDecember 8, 2020. We raised aggregate net proceeds of $3.3 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and\ncommissions of $81 million and offering costs of approximately $19 million subject to certain cost reimbursements.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds we received from our IPO for general corporate purposes, including working\ncapital, operating expenses, repaying the 2020 convertible notes, and capital expenditures. Additionally, we may\nuse a portion of the net proceeds we received from our IPO to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services,\nor technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at\nthis time. In November 2020 we announced a $200 million pledge, as part of our Main Street Strong program, to\nsupport merchants, Dashers, and local communities. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds we received from\nour IPO to satisfy a portion of our anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the vesting\nand settlement of RSUs that we have granted. A majority of the RSUs that we have granted to date generally vest\nupon the satisfaction of both service-based and liquidity event-related performance vesting conditions occurring\nbefore the award’s expiration date. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied by the award holder\nproviding services to us over a four-year period. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was\nsatisfied on the Effective Date.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in\nthe section titled “Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nWe have built a technology-enabled local logistics platform that enables local brick-and-mortar businesses to\naddress consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy. Our local\nlogistics platform connects over 450,000 merchants, over 20 million consumers, and over 1 million Dashers in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Australia every month.\nWe built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through our\nMarketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such\nas customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support.\nOur Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It generates significant\ndemand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through\ndelivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a\nvariety of products, which we refer to as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants that have generated\nconsumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our local logistics platform. Storefront\nenables merchants to create their own\n64\nTable o f Contents\nbranded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to\ne-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at\nthe public offering price of $102.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares\nin the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Business and Non-GAAP Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business\nand non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business\nplans, and make strategic decisions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018           2019            2020\n-in millions, except percentages\nTotal Orders                                                              83            263             816\nMarketplace GOV                          $                             2,812       $  8,039       $  24,664\nContribution Profit (Loss)(1)            $                               -59       $   -200       $     663\nContribution Margin(1)                                                   -20  %         -23  %           23  %\nContribution Profit (Loss) as a % of                                      -2  %          -2  %            3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                       $                              -158       $   -475       $     189\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)                                                -54  %         -54  %            7  %\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                                     -6  %          -6  %            1  %\nGOV\n(1) Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most\ndirectly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\".\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed\nthrough our Marketplace and our Drive offering, over the period of measurement. Total Orders have increased over\ntime as we have added new consumers, increased retention and engagement of existing consumers, including through\nthe launch of DashPass, expanded into new markets, and increased the number of orders completed through Drive.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Total Orders increased to 816 million, or 210% growth compared to the year\nended December 31, 2019. The increase in Total Orders was driven by increased retention and engagement of existing\nconsumers, the addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Drive. These\ntrends accelerated in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in in-store dining shutdowns\nand the adoption of shelter-in-place measures. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business\nstemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a widespread rollout of the\nCOVID-19 vaccine, and we expect the growth rate of Total Orders to decline in future periods.\nAs we continue to increase consumer adoption and make using DoorDash a regular activity, we expect Total Orders to\ncontinue to grow.\n65\nTable o f Contents\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of Marketplace orders completed on our local\nlogistics platform, including taxes, tips, 5 and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to\nDashPass. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does\nnot include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through\nDrive because we utilize a per-order fee structure for such orders and typically do not receive information\nregarding the dollar value of such orders. Marketplace GOV is primarily driven by the volume and dollar value of\norders completed on our local logistics platform.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Marketplace GOV increased to $24.7 billion, or 207% growth compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2019, based on the growth in Total Orders as well as the increasing size of Marketplace\norders in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our\nbusiness stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a widespread\nrollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect the growth rate in Marketplace GOV to decline in future periods.\nWe expect that Marketplace GOV will continue to grow as Total Orders grow, though at a slower rate, as Marketplace\nGOV does not include Drive while Total Orders do include Drive. We further expect that Marketplace GOV will grow at\na slower rate than Total Orders as we continue to broaden our selection of merchants at lower price points to\nincrease affordability for consumers. We are purposefully increasing the affordability of the selection of goods\noffered by merchants on our platform to improve consumer engagement over time.\n5 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n66\nTable o f Contents\nContribution Profit (Loss). 6 We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\nand (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is\ndefined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and\namortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a\npercentage of revenue for the same period.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Contribution Profit improved to $663 million, compared to a Contribution Loss\nof $200 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the growth in Marketplace GOV, increased merchant\ncommissions and fees from our Marketplace as well as Drive, cost structure improvements, and increased operating\nleverage as a result of scale in our business. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Contribution Margin increased\nto 23%, compared to negative 23% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cost structure improvements and\nincreased operating leverage as a result of scale in our business.\nOur Contribution Profit (Loss) can vary significantly as we invest in enhancing the scale of our local logistics\nplatform, including through investments in sales and marketing and promotions spend and launching new products and\ngeographies. We expect Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin to fluctuate in the near term as we\ncontinue to invest in the growth of our business, and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale,\nincrease adoption, and drive efficiency through operational improvements.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss)\nis not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is\nnot a financial measure of profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for the profitability of\nour business nor does it imply profitability.\n6 For more information about Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin, including the limitations of such\nmeasures, and a reconciliation of Contribution Profit (Loss) to gross profit (loss), the most directly comparable\nfinancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n67\nTable o f Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA. 7 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and\nregulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract\nrelated to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property\nand equipment, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii)\ninterest income and expense, (viii) foreign exchange gain (loss), (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that\nwe use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is\ncalculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA improved to $189 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of\nnegative $475 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin increased to 7%, compared to negative 54% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cost structure\nimprovements and increased operating leverage as a result of scale in our business.\nWe expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to fluctuate in the near term as we continue to invest in our\nbusiness and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business and efficiencies in our\noperating expenses.\n7 For more information about Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, including the limitations of such measures\nand more detail on the specific adjustments, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\n68\nTable o f Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our local\nlogistics platform to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our local logistics\nplatform to arrange for delivery services. We recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an\nagent for both partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner\nmerchants and fees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which\nincludes certain discounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer.\nRevenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s\nproducts.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our\nMarketplace revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the\ncontractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of subscription purchased by the\nconsumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Drive offering. We generate revenue from\nDrive by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery\nservices that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in\ntime when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\n69\nTable o f Contents\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, costs related to placing orders\nwith non-partner merchants, and insurance expenses, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding\nmerchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform\ninfrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nour local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses\nprimarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined\nbased on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information\ntechnology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount.\nWe expect that the cost of revenue will increase on an absolute dollar basis as our business grows and as we\ncontinue to invest in order management and our platform and hire additional employees for our local operations,\nsupport, and other teams to support the growth in our business. As a result, we expect that cost of revenue as a\npercentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long term as we\nachieve greater scale and operational efficiency.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we invest to grow our\nnetwork of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and enhance our brand awareness. We expect sales and marketing\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long\nterm.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses\nassociated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees to support our research and development efforts to expand the capabilities\nand scope of our platform and offerings. As a result, we expect that research and development expenses will\nincrease on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to invest to support these activities. We expect that research\nand development expenses as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and\ndecrease over the long term.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, acquisition-related expenses, and allocated\noverhead.\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis due to increases in\nchargebacks associated with fraudulent credit card transactions and legal, tax, and regulatory expenses as we add\npersonnel and enhance our systems, processes, and controls to support the growth in our business as well as our\nincreased compliance and reporting requirements as a public company. We expect general and administrative expenses\nas a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long term.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nour property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with equipment for\nmerchants, including equipment for merchants under finance leases, computer equipment and software, office\nequipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets.\n70\nTable o f Contents\nWe expect that depreciation and amortization expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we invest in\nproperty and equipment to support the growth in our business. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses as a\npercentage of revenue over the short term will vary from period to period and decrease over the long term.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind interest\non our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net primarily consists of a non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract liability\nin connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. To accommodate\nthe timing of regulatory approvals required by an existing investor, we committed to sell $100 million of shares of\nour Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor in a subsequent closing, which ultimately\noccurred after we had entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell shares of Series G redeemable convertible\npreferred stock at a higher price per share than our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. We determined\nthat the commitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor\nwas a forward contract that should be classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis,\nwith changes in fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. This\nforward contract was entered into in February 2019 and settled in May 2019. Other (expense) income, net also\nincludes gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes primarily consists of U.S. federal and state income tax and franchise tax, as well as\ninternational taxes from foreign operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall\nunderstanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to\nmetrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of\nmanagement, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors\nto use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our\nindustry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted\nresearch and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss),\nContribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nshould be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to\nreview our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research\nand development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution\nMargin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction\nwith their respective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\n78\nTable o f Contents\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and allocated overhead.

These excluded\ncosts and expenses consist of (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses related to\nthe following: (a) worker classification matters, which were $13 million, $73 million, and $92 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively (b) our historical Dasher pay model prior to the change\nto such pay model in 2019, which were zero for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively,\nand $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and (c) our September 2019 data breach incident, which were\nzero, $1 million, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, (ii) reserves for\nthe collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, which were $6\nmillion, $11 million, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, (iii) expenses\nrelated to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls,\nwhich were zero, $1 million, and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively,\nand (iv) donations as part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts, which were zero for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe it is\nappropriate to exclude legal matter costs related to worker classification matters, our historical Dasher pay model\nand our September 2019 data breach incident from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense\nbecause (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting\nor forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such\nexpenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative\nand regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22.\nContribution Profit (Loss)\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. We define Contribution Profit (Loss)\nas our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related\nto cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of\nrevenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and\nmarketing expenses.

Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the\nconsummation of an IPO of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the\nfederal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants\nunder the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were drawn and we had $44\nmillion of issued letters of credit outstanding from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nConvertible Notes\nOn February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the\nConvertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto, or\nthe Note Investors. We received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an\noriginal issue discount of $5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable\nquarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible\nNotes in full for $375 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our Class A\nshares in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $4.9 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion, and marketable securities of $514\nmillion. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of $146 million represent cash due from our payment\nprocessors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors\nfor Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money\nmarket funds. Marketable securities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.6\nbillion as of December 31, 2020. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n83\nTable o f Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018        2019        2020\n-in millions\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating    $                     -159    $   -467    $    252\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                             -357        -570        -192\nNet cash provided by financing                                     666       1,109       3,996\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                —           —           2\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents,     $                      150    $     72    $  4,058\nand restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This consisted of a net\nloss of $204 million offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $24 million and non-cash depreciation\nand amortization expense of $9 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an\nincrease of $30 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, an increase of $19 million in funds held at\npayment processors, an increase of $17 million in accounts receivable, net, and an increase of $5 million in other\nassets due to timing of payments, offset by an increase of $48 million in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities, an increase of $25 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $10 million in other liabilities.\nCash used in operating activities was $467 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This consisted of a net\nloss of $667 million offset by a non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract liability of $67 million, non-\ncash depreciation and amortization expense of $32 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use\nassets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $22 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of\n$18 million, and non-cash bad debt expense of $4 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities was\nprimarily the result of an increase of $88 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, an increase of $40\nmillion in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $18 million in other assets, an increase of $9 million in funds\nheld at payment processors, a decrease of $23 million in other liabilities due to timing of legal settlements, a\ndecrease of $13 million in accounts payable, and a decrease of $3 million for payments for operating lease\nliabilities, offset by an increase of $251 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily\nrelated to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and indirect taxes, accrued operations related\nexpenses, and Dasher and merchant payable. The increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was mainly due to the increase in net loss for the year.\nCash provided by operating activities was $252 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of a\nnet loss of $461 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $322 million, non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $120 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets\nand accretion of operating lease liabilities of $40 million, non-cash interest expense of $31 million related to\nthe convertible notes, non-cash bad debt expense of $16 million, and other non-cash expenses of $18 million. The\nnet changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase of $587 million in accrued expenses\nand other current liabilities, primarily related to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and\nindirect taxes, accrued operations related expenses, Dasher and merchant payable, and contract liabilities, an\nincrease of $54 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $11 million in other liabilities, offset by an\nincrease of $248 million in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $96 million in funds held at payment\nprocessors, an increase of $96 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a decrease of $26 million for\npayments for operating lease liabilities, and an increase of $20 million in other assets. The increase in cash\nprovided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nwas mainly due to the decrease in net loss and increases in non-cash expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $357 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which consisted of\npurchases of marketable securities of $390 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13 million, and cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $3 million, offset by proceeds from the\nmaturities of marketable securities of $49 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $570 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily consisted\nof purchases of marketable securities of $762 million, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $315\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $78 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website\ndevelopment costs of $14 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $600\nmillion.\n84\nTable o f Contents\nCash used in investing activities was $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted\nof purchases of marketable securities of $593 million, purchases of property and equipment of $106 million, cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $53 million, and cash paid for acquisitions, net\nof cash acquired, of $28 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $587\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $666 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which consisted of\n$725 million of net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $5 million of proceeds\nfrom the exercise of stock options, offset by $60 million of cash outflows due to repurchases of common stock and\n$4 million of cash outflow from other financing activities.\nCash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily\nconsisted of $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $3\nmillion of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $3 million of cash outflows for payment\nof deferred offering costs.\nCash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of\n$3.3 billion of proceeds from issuance of common stock upon our IPO, net of underwriter discounts, $382 million of\nnet proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, $333 million of net proceeds from the\nissuance of convertible promissory notes, and $5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by\n$7 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $6 million of\npayment of deferred offering costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal       Less than         1-3         3-5       More than\n(in millions)          1 Year       Years       Years         5 Years\nOperating lease               $                     533    $         36    $     92    $     86    $        319\ncommitments(1)\nNon-cancelable purchase                             416             119         216          81               —\ncommitments(2)\nTotal contractual\nobligations and               $                     949    $        155    $    308    $    167    $        319\ncommitments\n(1) The contractual commitment amounts under operating leases in the table above are primarily related to corporate\noffice facility leases. The table above does not reflect obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a\nsignificant penalty, our option to exercise early termination rights, or the payment of related early termination\nfees.\n(2) As of December 31, 2020, our non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily pertained to the purchase of\nonboarding, technology platform infrastructure services and advertising services. The purchase commitments end on\nvarious dates that extend into 2025. These purchase commitments were not recorded as liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, as we had not yet received the related services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing\narrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities\nsometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of\nfacilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented.. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\n85\nTable o f Contents\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. We charge partner merchants commissions at an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of\ngoods ordered in exchange for the use of our local logistics platform and we charge fees to consumers for use of\nour platform to arrange for delivery services. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for\nDashPass, which is recognized as part of the DoorDash Marketplace. Revenue generated from DashPass subscriptions is\nrecognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on\nthe type of subscription purchased by the consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering\nby collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services\nthat fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time\nwhen the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nOur local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand the delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore further judgment is\nrequired to determine whether we are a principal or agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and\nDashers.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplace. The consumer accesses our local\nlogistics platform to identify merchants and place an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as we neither have the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor do we\nobtain economic benefits from the products.\nWith respect to delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as an agent for the consumer\nin facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our role with the delivery\nfacilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective Dashers, we do not\ncontrol how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nAs we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, we report revenue on a net basis,\nreflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligations to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through our Marketplace. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards\nare deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on our platform.\nWhen gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected\nfrom consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nRefunds and Credits\n86\nTable o f Contents\nFrom time to time, we issue credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may arise with\norders. We account for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore record the amount of each refund or\ncredit issued as a reduction to revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nWe offer incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use our local logistics platform. Consumers typically\nreceive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the incentives\nare described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nWe use promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to our platform. Promotions\noffered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: We record discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and reduce\nrevenue on the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.\nConsumer referrals: We offer referral credits to our existing consumers for referrals of new consumers. These\nreferral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these credits\nthat is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess of the fair\nvalue of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, we offer promotional discounts to existing consumers. We record\nincentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduce revenue on the date we record the corresponding\nrevenue transaction.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay: We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals: We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time we record\nthe corresponding revenue transaction.\nLeases\nWe apply the guidance in ASC 842 and determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. We adopted\nASC 842 on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used the effective date as the\ndate of initial application. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components\nfor all of our leases.\nA contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of\ntime in exchange for consideration. Our classes of assets that are leased include real estate leases and equipment\nleases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases consist of equipment leases and are\nincluded in property and equipment, net on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we have elected the\nshort-term lease exception for all classes of assets, and therefore do not apply the recognition requirements for\nleases of 12 months or less.\nWe sublease certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the subleases\nare commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the subleases\ngenerally\n87\nTable o f Contents\nrange from four to five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual value guarantees\nor other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, we use the applicable incremental\nborrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes of\nperforming lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate represents\nthe rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal\nto the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because we do not generally borrow on a collateralized\nbasis, we use a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for collateralization, current available yield\ncurves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and in accordance with the\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held\nCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors determined the best estimate of fair value\nof our common stock exercising reasonable judgment and considering numerous objective and subjective factors. These\nfactors included:\ncontemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock;\nthe prices at which we or other holders sold our common and redeemable convertible preferred stock to outside\ninvestors in arms-length transactions;\nthe rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our\ncommon stock;\nthe price paid by us to repurchase outstanding shares through tender offer;\nour financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources;\nthe industry outlook;\nthe fact that option and RSU grants have involved rights in illiquid securities in a private company;\nthe valuation of comparable companies;\nthe lack of marketability of our common stock;\nthe timing and likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our\ncompany given prevailing market conditions;\nthe history and nature of our business, industry trends, and competitive environment; and\ngeneral economic outlook including economic growth, inflation, unemployment, interest rate environment, and\nglobal economic trends.\nOur board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by first determining the enterprise value of\nour business, and then allocating the value among the various classes of our equity securities to derive a per\nshare value of our common stock. This process involved the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are\nhighly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and future cash flows,\ndiscount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future\nevents. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions\nimpacted our valuations as of each valuation date and could have had a material impact on the valuation of our\ncommon stock.\nFor valuations after the completion of the IPO, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of\nunderlying Class A common stock based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of\ngrant.\nFair Value of Common Stock Underlying Share-Based Payment Awards\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Estimating\nthe grant date fair value of the common stock underlying RSU grants prior to our IPO was highly judgmental due to\nthe lack of an observable market for our common stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common\nstock was determined by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-\nparty valuations of our\n88\nTable o f Contents\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including our IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry-specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. Estimating the grant date fair value of the RSUs, including the CEO Performance Award discussed\nbelow, was highly sensitive due to the volume of RSUs granted and increasing common stock value as we approached\nthe IPO. With the exception of the CEO Performance Award discussed below, most of our RSUs granted prior to\nNovember 2020 vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-related\nperformance vesting condition. The fair value of RSUs is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite\nservice period, using the accelerated attribution method, once the liquidity event-related performance vesting\ncondition becomes probable of being achieved. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied by the\naward holder providing services to us over a four-year period. The liquidity event-related performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our IPO registration statement. Stock-based compensation expense\nfor RSUs that had not met the service-based vesting condition as of December 31, 2020 will be recorded over the\nremaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, we have only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction\nof a service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, our board of directors granted the CEO Performance Award, an RSU award under our 2014 Stock Plan\nto Mr. Xu for up to 10,379,000 shares of our Class A common stock. The CEO Performance Award vests upon the\nsatisfaction of a service condition and the achievement of certain stock price goals. We estimated the grant date\nfair value of the CEO Performance Award using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use\nof a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the stock price goals may not\nbe satisfied. One of the most judgmental assumptions in the Monte Carlo simulation is the estimated fair value of\nthe common stock underlying the award as discussed above. The average grant date fair value of the CEO Performance\nAward was estimated to be $39.83 per share, and we will recognize total stock-based compensation expense of\napproximately $413 million over the derived service period of each of the nine performance tranches. If the stock\nprice goals are met sooner than the derived service period, we will adjust our stock-based compensation expense to\nreflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested award. Provided that Mr. Xu continues to be our Chief\nExecutive Officer, we will recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, regardless\nof whether the stock price goals are achieved.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results\nmay differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if\nnew information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of\noperations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance programs to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded self-insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred\nbut not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our self-insured ultimate\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. We use assumptions based\non actuarial judgment with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development factors, which\nincludes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. To limit our exposure to some\nrisks, we maintain additional third-party insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions. We cannot predict\nwhether this third-party insurance will be adequate to cover all potential hazards incidental to our business.\nReserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes\nknown. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved\namounts.\n89\nTable o f Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nWe record sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated,\nand such reserve is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe continue to analyze possible sales tax exposure but do not currently believe that any individual claim or\naggregate claims that might arise will ultimately have a material effect on our results of operations, financial\nposition, or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars and have international revenue, as well as costs\ndenominated in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our\ninternational businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening of the\nU.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n90\nTable o f Contents\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\n91\nTable o f Contents"

Our responsibility is\nto express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of self-insurance reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a combination of third-\nparty insurance and self-insurance programs to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury\nand physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The self-\ninsurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred\nbut not yet reported. The Company’s liability for self-insurance claims as of December 31, 2020 was $55 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's self-insurance reserves as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of\nthe key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and expected loss\nrates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized skill and\nknowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\n93\nTable o f Contents\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved actuarial\nprofessionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n● evaluating the qualifications of the Company’s external actuaries by assessing their certifications and\ndetermining whether they met the Qualification Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries\n● assessing the methods used by the Company’s external actuaries by comparing them to actuarial standards of\npractice\n● developing an independent range of the self-insurance reserves by selecting loss development factors and expected\nloss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\nGrant date fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs)\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has granted RSUs. Certain RSUs\ncontain a market condition, specifically the CEO Performance Award. The fair value of RSUs are estimated based on\nthe fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Prior to the Company’s initial public offering,\nthe fair value of the Company’s common stock underlying the RSUs was determined by considering a number of\nobjective and subjective factors, including third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock and sales of the\nCompany’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock, amongst other factors. The fair value of the CEO\nPerformance Award was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation due to the market condition. Total stock-based\ncompensation for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $322 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimated grant date fair value of RSUs as a critical audit matter. Subjective\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate the weighting given to third-party valuations of the Company’s common\nstock and sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock that were used to determine the\nfair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In addition, complex auditor judgment was required\nto evaluate the timing and likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, which were significant assumptions used in\nthe third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock. Specialized skills and knowledge were necessary to\nevaluate the Company’s third-party valuations of its common stock and the CEO Performance Award.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign of the internal control related to the weighting given to third-party valuations of the Company’s common\nstock and sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock that were used to determine the\nfair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. We evaluated the Company’s weighting given to third-\nparty valuations of the Company’s common stock and sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock, by assessing:\n● market information related to conditions and events affecting the Company\n● the effect of the Company’s operations on the value of its common stock during the year.\nWe analyzed the timing and likelihood of the Company achieving a liquidity event by (1) inspecting its written\nplans or other relevant documentation, such as minutes and regulatory filings, and (2) assessing its ability to\ncarry out particular courses of action, which included consideration of whether the Company has the financial\nresources and other means to carry out the actions. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n● evaluating the qualifications of the Company's valuation professionals by assessing their certifications and\ndetermining whether they met the qualifications necessary to perform independent common stock and CEO Performance\nAward valuations\n● evaluating the method employed by third party valuation professionals and assumptions used to value the Company’s\ncommon stock\n● developing an independent estimate of the CEO Performance Award and comparing it to the Company’s grant date fair\nvalue.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 5, 2021\n94\nTable o f Contents\nDoorDash, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in

Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany provides a local logistics platform that enables local brick-and-mortar businesses to address consumers’\nexpectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the\nDoorDash Marketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting\nthem with consumers (the “Marketplace”). Merchants can either fulfill this demand with independent contractors who\nuse the Company’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”) or by in-person pickup by consumers. As part of the\nMarketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick\nup their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the\nCompany’s platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also\nincludes DashPass, the Company’s subscription product, which provides consumers with unlimited access to eligible\nmerchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the Company offers\nDoorDash Drive, a white-label logistics service that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through\ntheir own channels to fulfill this demand using the Company’s local logistics platform (“Drive”), and DoorDash\nStorefront that enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a\nturnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or\nlogistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold\n33million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $ 102.00per share. The Company\nreceived net proceeds of $ 3.3billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock automatically converted into 239million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior\nto the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\nauthorizes a total of 6.0billion shares of Class A common stock, 200million shares of Class B common stock,\n2.0billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285million shares of the Company’s common stock were automatically\nreclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Reclassification”).\nImmediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31million shares of Class\nA common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for\nan equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a\nresult, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with both service-based and liquidity event-\nrelated performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company’s IPO, the Company\nrecognized $ 279million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs will be delivered on the\napplicable settlement date, which is approximately 180days after the IPO. The future tax benefits on settlement of\nthe above RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to\nreduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net\nshare settle, the Company withheld 65,058shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested\nRSUs and paid $ 7million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any\nincome tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to\nreceive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that will accrue at the applicable federal rate. The\nshort-term loan extended to employees totaled $ 10million as of December 31, 2020 and is included within prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets on the\n101\nTable o f Contents\nCompany's consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the loan is repayable from the proceeds of sale of shares\ninto the market on the settlement date.\nStock Splits\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a five-for-one\nforward stock split of the Company’s common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock (collectively, the\n“Capital Stock”), which became effective on November 9, 2020. The authorized number of each class and series of\nCapital Stock was proportionally increased in accordance with the five-for-one stock split and the par value of\neach class of Capital Stock was not adjusted as a result of this forward stock split. All common stock, redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, warrants, and per share information presented within these\nconsolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this forward stock split on a retroactive basis for\nall periods presented.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DoorDash, Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 for revenue by geography. As of December 31, 2019, long-lived assets\nlocated outside of the United States were not material. As of December 31, 2020, long-lived assets located outside\nof the United States were $ 21million .\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe period presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses,\nestimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development costs, intangible\nassets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments, valuation of acquired\nintangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance reserves,\nloss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of\n102\nTable o f Contents\nthe measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash\nconsists of collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance\npolicies. As of December 31, 2020, the restricted cash balance was not material.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits\nthe concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with original maturities greater than\nthree months, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with original maturities\ngreater than one year are included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable\nsecurities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the\nCompany evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the\namortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically\nrelated to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nWhen a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the\ndebt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be\nrecorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for cleared transactions\nwith merchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants generated through the Company’s Drive\noffering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company’s assessment of the\ncollectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a\ncollective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay and\ncollection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nThe Company recorded $ 16million of bad debt expense in the year ended December 31, 2020. Write-off in the year\nended December 31, 2020 totaled $ 5million. Bad debt expense was not material in the years ended December 31, 2018\nand 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $ 2million and $\n13million, respectively.\n103\nTable o f Contents\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.There were no disposals during the year ended December 31, 2018 and disposals were not material for the years\nended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2020 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Noimpairment charge was recorded in any\nof the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and\nused for impairment under the long-lived asset model described under “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized an impairment of $\n11million related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with its former headquarters, which the\nCompany subleased to another company.\n104\nTable o f Contents\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance programs to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded self-insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred\nbut not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s self-insured\nultimate obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. The Company\nutilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgment with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss\ndevelopment factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. To\nlimit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains additional insurance coverage with varying limits and\nretentions. The Company cannot predict whether this insurance will be adequate to cover all potential hazards\nincidental to its business. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or\nnew information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could\nresult in losses over the Company’s reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized\ngains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into U.S.\ndollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model. The fair value of stock options is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period, which is typically four years.\nThe Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based\nawards. These variables include:\nper share fair value of the underlying common stock;\nexercise price;\nexpected term;\nrisk-free interest rate;\nexpected stock price volatility over the expected term; and\nexpected annual dividend yield.\n105\nTable o f Contents\nFor all stock options granted, the Company calculated the expected term using the simplified method for “plain\nvanilla” stock option awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-\ncoupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock-based award. The Company’s common stock is not\npublicly traded, and therefore, the Company used the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly\ntraded peer companies. The Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring\ndividends on its common stock.\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.\nPrior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting\ncondition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. The\nliquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the Company's IPO, and\nthe Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 279million as of the IPO date for those\nRSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the\nremaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will\nbe recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. Since November\n2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award (as discussed further in Note 12), the Company only granted\nRSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these\nRSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award is determined using a\nMonte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the derived service period,\nusing the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the derived service period,\nthe Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the\nvested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether the stock price goals\nare achieved.\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying\ncommon stock. The Company’s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company’s common stock by\nconsidering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined\nbased on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net\namount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of\nfuture taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly\n106\nTable o f Contents\ntransaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s\nconvertible promissory notes entered into in February 2020, which are recorded at amortized cost, approximates fair\nvalue as the stated interest rate approximates market rates for similar loans.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processor, which are included in funds held at payment\nprocessors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to Dashers and\nmerchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-authorizes forms\nof payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering.As of December 31, 2019, two entities individually accounted for 26% and 11% of accounts receivable,\nnet, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, three entities in dividually accounted for 20%, 14%, and 10% of\naccounts receivable, net, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through the DoorDash Marketplace and the related commissions charged\nto partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into\na contractual agreement with DoorDash. Revenue from the DoorDash Marketplace is recognized at the point in time\nwhen the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership\nfees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of the DoorDash Marketplace. Revenue generated\nfrom the Company’s DashPass subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of subscription purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\n107\nTable o f Contents\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\nlogistics platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local logistics platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item\nseparately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable\nas the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service\nindividually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in DoorDash Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through the DoorDash Marketplace. The consumer accesses the\nCompany’s local logistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders\nare picked up from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the\nproducts prior to them being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to\nanother consumer nor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as an agent for the\nconsumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the Company’s role with\nthe delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective\nDashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nAs the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, the Company reports revenue\non a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. Dasher\npayout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for certain\nreferral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a reduction\nin Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nDoorDash also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through its Marketplace. Proceeds from the sale of\ngift cards are deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its\nplatform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts\ncollected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\n108\nTable o f Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local logistics platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, costs related to placing orders\nwith non-partner merchants, and insurance expenses, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding\nmerchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform\ninfrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nthe Company’s local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation\nexpenses primarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is\ndetermined based on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and\ninformation technology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount. As such, allocated shared costs\nare reflected in each of the expense categories.\nSales and Marketing\n109\nTable o f Contents\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.Advertising expenses were $\n81million, $ 446million, and $ 698million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to the Company’s platform, as well as\nexpenses associated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, acquisition-related expenses, and allocated\noverhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nthe Company’s property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with\nequipment for merchants, including equipment for merchants under finance leases, computer equipment and software,\noffice equipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with the Company’s\ncapitalized software and website development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and\namortization are excluded from cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common\nstockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating securities\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any\nremaining earnings would be distributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common\nstock pro rata on an as-converted basis. These holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are\nnot contractually obligated to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, the Company’s net losses for the years\nended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were not allocated to these participating securities. The rights, including\nthe liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock\nare substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock shared proportionately in the Company’s net losses. Noshares of Class C common stock were issued and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2020. Prior to the completion of the IPO, there were noshares of Class B common\nstock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic\nnet loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not\nbeen settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company’s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred\nstock were automatically converted into 239million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified\ninto stockholders' (deficit) equity. As of December 31, 2020, there were noshares of redeemable convertible\npreferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDeferred Offering Costs\n110\nTable o f Contents\nDeferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, consulting, accounting, and other fees relating\nto the anticipated sale of the Company’s common stock in the IPO, are initially capitalized and recorded in other\nassets on the consolidated balance sheets.As of December 31, 2019, deferred offering costs capitalized was $\n5million. After the IPO, all deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders' (deficit) equity as a\nreduction of the IPO proceeds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company applies the guidance in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC\n842”). The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used\nthe effective date as the date of initial application. Consequently, financial information is not updated and the\ndisclosures required under ASC 842 are not provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. The Company\nelected the package of practical expedients available in the leasing transition guidance, and therefore did not\nreassess whether existing or expired contracts contain leases, lease classification, or initial direct costs.\nAdditionally, the Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for\nall of the Company’s leases. The Company also has elected the short-term lease exception for all classes of assets,\nand therefore does not apply the recognition requirements for leases of 12 months or less. Expense related to\nshort-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as incurred depending on whether the\nlease payments are fixed or variable. Variable lease payments were not material for the years ended December 31,\n2019 and 2020. The Company did not utilize the practical expedient allowing the use of hindsight in determining the\nlease term and in assessing impairment of its operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real estate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases\nconsist of real estate leases and are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases consist of equipment leases and are included in property and\nequipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from fourto five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no\nresidual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ngenerally borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments” (\"ASU 2016-13\"). The new guidance requires the measurement and recognition\nof expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized costs. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred\nloss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to\ncalculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires\ncredit losses related to certain available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. Effective on December 31, 2020,\nthe Company lost its emerging growth company (\"EGC\") status which accelerated the requirement of the adoption of\nASU 2016-13. As a result, the Company adopted 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1,\n2020. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to its consolidated financial statement.\n111\nTable o f Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income\nTaxes\", which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the\nmethodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for\noutside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and\nenacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the\ntax basis of goodwill. For public business entities, this standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance\nwas effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, \"Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\" which removes separation models for\nconvertible debt with a cash conversion feature and convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature.\nSuch convertible debt will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and convertible\npreferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no\nother features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The update also requires the if-converted method\nto be used for convertible instruments and the effect of potential share settlement be included in the diluted\nearnings per share calculation when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For public business entities,\nthe standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those\nfiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption\nof the update on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, \"Codification Improvements\", which improves the Codification by\nhaving all disclosure-related guidance available in the Disclosure Sections of the Codification and also contains\nCodification improvements that vary in nature. For public business entities, this amendment is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. The\nCompany does not believe the amendments will have a material impact on the disclosures to its consolidated\nfinancial statement.\n3. Revenue\nThe following tables present the Company’s revenue disaggregated by offering and by geographical region.\nRevenue by offering was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019        2020\nCore business    $                      282    $   876    $  2,886\nOther revenue                             9          9           —\nTotal revenue    $                      291    $   885    $  2,886\nCore business is primarily comprised of Marketplace, which includes Pickup and DoorDash for Work, and Drive.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the\naddress of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019        2020\nUnited States    $                      282    $   877    $  2,875\nInternational                             9          8          11\nTotal revenue    $                      291    $   885    $  2,886\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nfor DashPass subscriptions, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is\nrecognized over time. The contract liabilities balance was $ 13million and $ 108million as of December 31, 2019 and\n2020, respectively, and the increase was primarily driven by increased sales of gift card in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\n112\nTable o f Contents\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities\nrelated to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019       2020\nBeginning balance                          $                        2    $     6    $    21\nCapitalization of deferred contract                                 5         19         32\ncosts\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                            -1         -4        -10\nEnding balance                             $                        6    $    21    $    43\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                        2    $     4    $    16\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                                4         17         27\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                        6    $    21    $    43\n4. Acquisitions\nCaviar Acquisition\nOn October 31, 2019, the Company acquired Caviar in an effort to help grow its business, advance its strategy of\noffering consumers differentiated merchant selection, and enable the Company to cater to even more food preferences\nand occasions. The acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition\ndate fair value of the consideration transferred was $ 411million, which consisted of $ 311million in cash,\nincluding $ 1million in seller transaction costs settled at closing, and $ 100million of the Company’s Series G\nredeemable convertible preferred stock. The Company’s acquisition-related costs were $ 5million and all costs were\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations during the\nperiod in which they were incurred.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Caviar acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition.\nManagement determined the fair values based on a number of factors, including a valuation from an independent\nthird-party valuation firm. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is attributable to the assembled workforce and anticipated synergies from the future growth and strategic\nadvantages in the food delivery industry. The goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Caviar is\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nOctober 31, 2019\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets         $                 4\nIntangible assets                                                 106\nGoodwill                                                          305\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities                     -3\nOther liabilities                                                  -1\nTotal purchase price                              $               411\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their\nestimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in years):\n113\nTable o f Contents\nEstimated\nUseful\nLife                  October 31, 2019\nExisting technology                             1.5    $                45\nVendor relationships                           13.0                     45\nCourier relationships                           1.5                      1\nCustomer relationships                          3.0                      9\nTrade name and trademarks                       3.0                      6\nTotal acquired intangible assets                       $               106\nExisting technology acquired primarily consists of Caviar’s online and mobile platform for restaurant pickup and\ndelivery orders. The estimated fair value of the existing technology and vendor relationships was determined based\non the present value of the expected cash flows to be generated by each existing technology and existing vendor\nrespectively. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a straight-line basis\nover their respective estimated useful lives.\nIncluded within the prepaid expenses and other current assets acquired is an indemnification asset of $ 3million,\nwhich relates to a corresponding assumed liability of $ 3million related to a probable and estimable legal\nsettlement for which Square, Inc. has provided an indemnification to the Company.\nThe amount of revenue from Caviar included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December\n31, 2019 was $ 15million.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Caviar acquisition\nhad been completed on January 1, 2018, the beginning of the comparable annual reporting period. The unaudited pro\nforma information is based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and primarily\nreflects adjustments for the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired\nintangible assets and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes\nonly and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have\nbeen if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they indicative of future\nresults of operations. The unaudited pro forma results were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019\nRevenue     $                      361    $   971\nNet loss                          -291       -726\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Scotty Labs, Inc., which was\naccounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred was $ 5million. The total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, which primarily consisted of $ 4million of intangible assets. The identifiable\nintangible assets acquired consisted entirely of existing technology, which has an estimated remaining useful life\nof 2years as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company recorded $ 1million of goodwill, which represented the\nexcess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired.\nIn December 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of a technology manufacturing\ncompany, which was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase consideration was\napproximately $ 30million, of which $ 3million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The\ntotal purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed,\nwhich primarily consisted of $ 22million of intangible assets.

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2021 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. The Company\nalso leased equipment for merchants under finance lease agreements and such assets were recorded within property\nand equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and\nactivities related to finance leases were not material for the periods presented.\nRent expense, net of sublease income, was $ 10million, $ 29million, and $ 46million during the years ended December\n31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nIn June 2019, the Company subleased its previous headquarters office space to another company (the “Sublessee”).\nThe sublease required Sublessee to pay 100% of any rent and other related expenses due and payable under the\nexisting lease with the landlord (the “Head Lease”), however the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation\nto the landlord under the Head Lease. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, an operating lease liability and an\noperating lease ROU asset was reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to the Head Lease.\nPrior to April 2020, all payments due and payable by Sublessee were made timely.\nIn early April 2020, as a result of a disruption to Sublessee’s business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sublessee\ninformed the Company that it would not be making any future monthly rent payments. Accordingly, the Company ceased\nrecognizing sublease income beginning in April 2020, and further determined that an impairment existed and\nrecognized an impairment charge of $ 11million during the year ended December 31, 2020, reducing the carrying value\nof the ROU asset to its estimated fair value. Fair value of the ROU asset was estimated using an income-approach\nbased on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the property based on current sublease market\nrent. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was continuing its efforts to obtain a subtenant for this space.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\n118\nTable o f Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020\nOperating lease cost     $                       22    $    40\nShort-term lease cost                            10         11\nSublease income                                  -3         -5\nTotal lease cost         $                       29    $    46\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2019            2020\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            10.2            10.7\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  7.12%           8.06%\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       12    $    32\nleases\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases    $                        1    $     —\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                      137    $    69\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 246million and $ 120million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced.

Promissory Notes\n2017 Convertible Promissory Notes\nIn September and December 2017, the Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the Company\nissued convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $ 60million (the “Notes”) to twoexisting\ninvestors and onenew investor. The Notes accrued interest at the rate of 1.29% per annum. The Notes could be\nredeemed or converted into redeemable convertible preferred stock upon either, (i) a change in control, or (ii) an\nequity financing of at least $ 50million. The Notes could also be accelerated upon the occurrence of a customary\nevent of default. In 2018, the Company issued Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, thereby satisfying\nthe Notes’ conversion condition. As a result, the outstanding principal and accrued interest of $ 60million\nconverted into a total of 11,752,210shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, which were converted\ninto Class A common stock upon the Company's IPO.\nPromissory Note Issued to Not-for-Profit Organization\nIn October 2019, the Company entered into a $ 30million promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) with a third-party\nnot-for-profit organization to support a 2020 ballot initiative in California. The Promissory Note does not bear\ninterest, and the Company has rights to demand repayment to the extent such funds have not been spent by the not-\nfor-profit organization. The Promissory Note, less any amounts spent, is payable to the Company upon the earlier of\n(i) the Company demanding a repayment or (ii) by December 31, 2020. The Company initially recorded the Promissory\nNote as a prepaid expense and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet and the Company’s portion of\namounts spent by the not-for-profit organization are recorded as general and administrative expenses as the funds\nare spent. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the Promissory Note was $ 29million, and was recorded in\nprepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying\nvalue of the Promissory Note was zeroas it was spent in full. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020,\nthe Company recorded $ 1million and $ 29million, respectively, in general and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n2020 Convertible Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an\ninitial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $\n2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest\nrate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. At the election of the Company, interest is to be paid in\ncash or by increasing the principal amount of the 2020 Notes by payment-in-kind. The 2020 Notes will be\nautomatically converted upon the later of (i) the one-yearanniversary of the issuance date of the 2020 Notes and\n(ii) the trading day that is the tenth trading day immediately following the date of a Qualified Public Company\nEvent ((i) and (ii), in either case, the “initial conversion date”). A Qualified Public Company Event for purposes\nof the 2020 Notes means any transaction, including a direct listing or an initial public offering, that (a) results\nin the Company’s common stock being registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and\nlisted on the NYSE, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or the Nasdaq Global Market and (b) in connection with a firm\ncommitment underwritten initial public offering with net proceeds of at least $ 100million. If, following a\nQualified Public Company Event, the conversion reference price for the 2020 Notes implies a market capitalization\nfor the Company that is less than $ 10billion, the 2020 Notes will automatically convert into a new non-convertible\nnote bearing identical terms to the 2020 Notes (other than with respect to conversion), which is prepayable without\npenalty at the Company’s option at any time. For purposes of the 2020 Notes, the “conversion reference price” means\nthe arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock for the ten trading\ndays immediately prior to the initial conversion date. If, following a Qualified Public Company Event, the\nconversion reference price for the 2020 Notes implies a market capitalization for the Company greater than $\n10billion, the 2020 Notes will automatically convert into shares of the Company’s common stock over a 40-trading\nday period based on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company’s common stock during such\nperiod; provided, the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to deliver cash in lieu of shares of common stock\nin connection with such conversion.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the 2020 Notes had a carrying value of $ 364million on the consolidated balance sheets,\nconsisting of the unpaid principal balance of $ 340million, plus unpaid accrued payment-in-kind interest of $\n30million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 1million and unamortized original issue discount of $\n5million. The Company amortizes the debt issuance costs and the original issue discount over the period until the\ninitial maturity date of the 2020 Notes. Amortization of debt issuance costs and the original issue discount were\nnot material for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n120\nTable o f Contents\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”) . The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased\nlegal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business\nmodel and operations. Further, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar\nto the test set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nOn November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\nalleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to the Company’s\nDasher pay model that was in effect from approximately September 2017 through September 2019. On November 24, 2020,\nthe Company agreed to a Consent Order and Judgment that resolved the matter with the Company paying $ 3million. The\nConsent Order and Judgment was signed by the Court on November 30, 2020. The Company recorded a $ 3million expense\nin the consolidated statements of operations within general and administrative expense during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 for this case.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters.\nIn October 2019, the Company made an offer, and in December 2019 it filed a settlement agreement, of $ 40million\nwith the representatives of Dashers that had filed actions in the States of California and Massachusetts in order\nto settle claims under the Private Attorney General Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification\nof Dashers against the Company. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August\n2016. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be\npaid by the Company from $ 40million to $ 41million. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amended\nsettlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company from $ 41million to $ 89million.\nIn March 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain\nDashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under the\nagreement, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible for settlement payments, subject to a\nthreshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. The Company anticipates\nthat the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual settlement\nagreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $ 70million. In July 2020, the Company transferred $\n69million into an escrow account, the settlement amount will be released and paid to claimants and claimants’\nattorneys if a minimum number of claimants agree to release their claims against the Company by the date specified\nwithin the settlement agreement. In December 2020, the number of claimants who agreed to release their claims\nagainst the Company exceeded the minimum and the Company is committed to release the settlement amount in the\nescrow account to claimants and claimants' attorneys in the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the\nsettlement amount was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July and August 2020, the Company reached additional agreements to resolve worker misclassification claims\nassociated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the\nCompany. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible for settlement\npayments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements.\nThe Company\n121\nTable o f Contents\nanticipates that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual\nsettlement agreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $ 16million.\nThe Company recorded the impact of these worker misclassification settlements in the respective period in which the\nclaims relate, resulting in general and administrative expense of $ 11million, $ 68million, and $ 83million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees\nin violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This\naction is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing\nto classify Dashers as independent contractors. In August 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed a motion\nfor preliminary injunction that would bar the Company from continuing to classify Dashers in California as\nindependent contractors during the pendency of this case. In December 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nwithdrew its request for preliminary injunction. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred;\nhowever, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data\nprocessing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not\nrecorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 as the Company has not\nyet received the related services. As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-\ncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2021                                   119\n2022                                   112\n2023                                   104\n2024                                    79\n2025                                     2\nTotal future minimum payments    $     416\nBank Commitments and Letters of Credit\nIn October 2019, the Company entered into letters of credit, established primarily for real estate leases and\ninsurance policies. The reimbursement obligations under these letters of credit are secured by cash held in\nrestricted depository accounts. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had $ 30million of letters of credit\noutstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company terminated these letters of credit.\nAdditionally, in November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides\nfor a $ 300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit\nfacility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal\n122\nTable o f Contents\nfunds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month\ninterest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative\ncovenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as\ncustomary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions,\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and\nacquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide\nfor $ 100million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon consummation of an IPO of the Company’s\ncommon stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $ 400million. The amendment and\nrestatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024 to August 7,\n2025.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2019, there were noamounts drawn related to this agreement. As of December 31, 2020, noamounts were\ndrawn and the Company had $ 44million of issued letters of credit outstanding from the revolving credit and\nguaranty agreement.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement\npursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $\n45.9062per share for gross proceeds of $ 382million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G\nprior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631shares of Class A common\nstock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nconversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company’s respective series preceding the\nCompany’s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nShares                                Per Share        Aggregate\nShares    Issued and          Issuance             Conversion       Liquidati…       Carrying\nSeries        Authorized    Outstandi…             Price                  Price       Preference          Value\nSeries A-1        13,330        13,330    $         0.15          $        0.15    $           2    $         7\nSeries A          27,159        27,159              0.73                   0.73               20             20\nSeries B           7,925         7,925              5.68                   5.48               45             45\nSeries C          26,839        26,839              4.79                   4.79              128            128\nSeries D          98,008        98,008              5.51    -1             5.51              540            535\nSeries E          18,055        18,055             13.85                  13.85              250            250\nSeries F          18,186        18,186             22.48                  22.48              409            476\nSeries G          21,165        21,165             37.94                  37.94              803            803\nSeries H           9,351         8,316             45.91                  45.91              382            382\nTotal            240,018       238,983                                             $       2,579    $     2,646\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $ 5.50688, except for shares issued\nvia the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the\nconversion price was $ 4.78778per share.\nForward Contract In Connection with Issuance of Series F Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn February 2019, the Company issued a total of 13,736,615shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock\nat $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 309million. To accommodate the timing of regulatory approvals\nrequired by an existing investor (who did not participate in the initial issuance of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock), the Company committed to sell 4,449,370shares of Series F redeemable convertible\npreferred stock at $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 100million to this investor in a subsequent closing,\nwhich ultimately occurred in May 2019. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material. At the date of the\ninitial closing, the Company determined that the\n123\nTable o f Contents\ncommitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor\nrepresented a freestanding instrument that should be classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of\noperations. The initial measurement of the liability at its fair value of $ 1million was recorded with a\ncorresponding reduction recognized in additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend distributed to the investor.\nImmediately prior to the subsequent closing in May 2019, the fair value of the liability was determined to be $\n68million, resulting in an expense of $ 67million recorded to other (expense) income, net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations which was attributable to the increase in the fair value of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock. Upon the subsequent closing, the carrying amount of the liability was reclassified to\nmezzanine equity.\nThe fair value of the liability (valued as a forward contract) at issuance and as of subsequent closing was\ndetermined with the following assumptions:\nAs of                 As of\nFebruary 22,               May 14,\n2019                  2019\nCurrent forward price per share             $         22.48          $      37.76\nContractual forward price per share         $         22.48          $      22.48\nRisk-free rate                                         2.46     %            2.41  %\nExpected years until subsequent closing                      0.23               —\nPresent value of contractual forward        $         22.35          $      22.48\nprice per share\nValue of the forward contract per share     $          0.13          $      15.28\nNumber of preferred shares issued in the          4,449,370             4,449,370\nsubsequent closing\nFair value of forward contract              $             1          $         68\nliability(in millions)\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was nopreferred stock issued and outstanding.\n12. Common Stock\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2019            2020\nConversion of outstanding redeemable             230,953               —\nconvertible preferred stock\nStock options issued and outstanding              36,247          33,802\nunder the 2014 Plan\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 and 2020          15,924          34,939\nPlan\nRemaining shares available for future             10,478          32,210\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                —           6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                            293,602         107,450\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or the 2014 Plan, which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based\n124\nTable o f Contents\nawards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of shares of common stock available\nfor issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan.\nAll outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the\nterms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights,\nperformance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the Company's employees,\ndirectors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are forfeited, canceled, or\nrepurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the\n2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the\n2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1, 2021 in an amount\nequal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total number of all classes of common\nstock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase, or (iii) such other\nnumber of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to the applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nour Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten years(or five\nyearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at prices no less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the exercise price\nof an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated\nfair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest over four years.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020 , the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and\nliquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied\nupon the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nwas achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 279million for those RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been\nsatisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related\nperformance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period. Since\nNovember 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award discussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest\nonly upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition which is generally four years.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\n125\nTable o f Contents\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $ 12million of stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award during\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nthe CEO Performance Award was $ 401million.\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 and 2020 Plan and related information was as follows (in millions, except\nshare amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nShares             subject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nAvailable                Options        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nfor Grant            Outstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December       10,478                 36,247    $       2.38                 6.92    $      1,070\n31, 2019\nShares authorized            40,493                      —\nOptions granted                   —                      —    $          —\nOptions exercised                 —                 -2,191    $       1.90                                  129\nOptions forfeited               254                   -254    $       1.94\nRSUs granted                -20,126                      —\nRSUs forfeited                1,046                      —\nShares withheld\nrelated to net share             65\nsettlement, returned\nto the 2020 Plan\nBalance as of December       32,210                 33,802    $       2.42                 5.92    $      4,744\n31, 2020\nExercisable as of                                   28,291    $       1.95                 5.61    $      3,983\nDecember 31, 2020\nVested and expected to\nvest as of                                          33,802    $       2.42                 5.92    $      4,744\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock as of the respective period-end dates.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020\nwas $ 24million, $ 47million, and $ 129million, respectively.

The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average\nperiod of 2.91years.\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan (\"the ESPP\"), which became effective on the business day immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\nregistration statement on Form S-1 related to the IPO. A total of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were\ninitially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance\nunder the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the\nfiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any) occurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A\ncommon stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of the outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the\nlast day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such period\nwill begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13. Tender Offer and Stock Repurchases\nIn September 2018, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of $ 100million in shares of\npreferred and common stock for $ 9.60per share for redeemable convertible preferred stock and $ 8.40per share for\ncommon stock from certain holders. The tender offer transaction was completed in October 2018 and an aggregate of\n189,685shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, 107,600shares of Series A-1 redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, and 7,014,335shares of common stock were repurchased by the Company for a total\nconsideration of $ 62million.\nThe purchase price in excess of the carrying value of repurchased Series A and A-1 redeemable convertible preferred\nstock of $ 3million was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, while the carrying value of the\nshares repurchased was recorded as a reduction of redeemable convertible preferred stock. The redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock repurchased was retired immediately thereafter. For common stock repurchased from\nemployees, the excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the fair value of the common stock totaled $\n9million and was recorded as stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. The common\nstock was retired immediately upon repurchase.\nAdditionally, in 2018, the Company repurchased 193,775shares of common stock from twoemployees as part of the\nseparation arrangement at a price in excess of the fair value on the date of repurchase. Stock-based compensation\nexpense as a result of the repurchase was not material during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This\nassessment\n129\nTable o f Contents\nconsiders matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable\nincome, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of the\ndeferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that\nit is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The weight\ngiven to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the lack of\nU.S. earnings history, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation\nallowance. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 154million and $ 97million in the years ended December\n31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n689million and $ 547million, respectively. Of the $ 689million of federal net operating losses, $ 629million is\ncarried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income. The remaining federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company also had $ 19million of federal and $ 12million of California research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards as of December 31, 2020. The federal research and development tax credits expire in varying amounts\nstarting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be subject\nto substantial restrictions in the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state tax law. The most recent analysis of the Company’s\nhistorical ownership changes was completed through December 31, 2019. Based on the analysis, the Company does not\nanticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act permits employers to defer the payment of the employer share of social\nsecurity taxes due for the period beginning March 27, 2020 and ending December 31, 2020. The Company deferred the\nemployer share of social security taxes from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Of the amounts deferred, 50%\nare required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% are required to be paid by December 31, 2022.\nThe Company completed its evaluation of the impact of the CARES Act, and with the exception of the expected impact\nfrom the payroll tax deferral, does not expect the provisions of the legislation to have a significant impact on\nthe effective tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, or income tax payable of the Company.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of both December 31, 2019 and 2020 was $ 7million of tax\nbenefits, that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to the valuation allowance.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019       2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        1    $     3    $     7\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                                2          4          3\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                  —          —         -3\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                        3    $     7    $     7\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for income taxes. The Company did not accrue any interest expense or penalties during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax returns generally remain subject to examination by United States\nfederal and state and foreign tax authorities.\n15. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock\nand participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock and Class B\n130\nTable o f Contents\ncommon stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock share equally in the Company’s net losses. Before the IPO, the Company’s outstanding securities also included\nconvertible preferred stock. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual\nobligation to share in the Company’s losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to these securities.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as\nvested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018         2019          2020\nCommon       Common       Class A       Class B\nNet loss                                    $                     -204    $    -667    $     -446    $      -15\nLess: Premium paid on repurchase of                                 -3            —             —             —\nredeemable convertible preferred stock\nLess: Deemed dividend to preferred                                   —           -1             —             —\nstockholders\nNet loss attributable to common             $                     -207    $    -668    $     -446    $      -15\nstockholders\nWeighted-average number of shares\noutstanding used to compute net loss per                        44,305       43,252        60,422         1,968\nshare attributable to common\nstockholders, basic and diluted\nNet loss per share attributable to          $                    -4.67    $  -15.44    $    -7.39    $    -7.39\ncommon stockholders, basic and diluted\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019      2020\nRedeemable convertible preferred stock                    191,602    230,953         —\n(on an as-converted basis)\nStock options to purchase common stock                     39,191     36,247    33,802\nUnvested restricted stock units(1)                          6,065     15,924    17,987\nCommon stock subject to repurchase                             25          —         —\nConvertible promissory notes                                    —          —     2,595\nTotal                                                     236,883    283,124    54,384\n(1) The CEO Performance Award is excluded from the above table because the Company Stock Price Target had not been\nmet as of December 31, 2020.\n16. 401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax\nearnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for eligible\nemployees.\n17.

                "content": "Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable\nassurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over\nfinancial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a\ntransition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\nChanges in Internal Control\nOther than as described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in\nmanagement’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting. As described below, we have implemented changes to our internal control over financial\nreporting to remediate the material weakness identified below.\nRemediation Efforts on Previously Identified Material Weakness\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31,\n2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our\ninternal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,\nin internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The\nmaterial weakness identified occurred because (i) we had inadequate processes and controls to ensure an appropriate\nlevel of precision related to our revenue to cash reconciliation process, and (ii) we did not have sufficient\nresources with the adequate technical skills to meet the emerging needs of our financial reporting requirements.\nIn response to this material weakness, we (i) hired additional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence\npersonnel and implemented process level and management review controls to identify and address emerging risks and\nenhance communication between our product, engineering, sales, business intelligence and accounting teams, and (ii)\nimplemented enhancements to our revenue to cash and reconciliation process to increase the level of precision\nrelated to such processes.\nWe believe our remediation efforts resulted in the elimination of the previously identified material weakness as of\nDecember 31, 2020. While this material weakness has been remediated, we cannot assure you that we have identified\nall of our existing material weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses. We\nhave dedicated resources to the design, implementation, documentation and testing of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting and will continue to make changes that we believe will strengthen our internal control over financial\nreporting to ensure that our financial statements continue to be fairly stated in all material respects.\nNeither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting during any period in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In\nlight of the material weakness that was previously identified as a result of the limited procedures performed, we\nbelieve that it is possible that, had we and our independent registered public accounting firm performed an\nevaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may have been identified.\n132\nTable o f Contents\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected."

                "content": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to achieve this by providing a logistics and technology\nplatform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ modern expectations of ease and immediacy.\nOur business consists of our Marketplace and Platform Services. We built our Marketplace to serve the needs of\nthree key constituents: merchants, consumers and Dashers. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online\npresence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand\nthrough delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. As part\nof our Marketplace, we offer merchants a broad array of services that enable them to solve mission-critical\nchallenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment\nprocessing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to\nacquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nOur Marketplace provides a platform for over 25 million monthly active users (\"MAU\") 1 to discover, engage with,\nand purchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value\nproposition by increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplace, while also\nimproving the level of convenience, quality, and service we provide. Marketplace also includes DashPass, our\nmembership program which aims to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery\nand service fees we charge consumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services\nbusiness, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand\nthey have generated through their own channels using our local logistics platform. Storefront enables merchants to\ncreate their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-\ndemand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nFor Dashers, both our Marketplace and Platform Services provide opportunities for those looking for accessible and\nflexible ways to earn and achieve their goals. Dashers choose when and where to dash, as well as how frequently and\nfor how long to dash each time they choose to do so. We provide earnings transparency so that Dashers can make\ninformed decisions about the deliveries they choose to make.\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents:\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with\na growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants to choose from, consistent and high quality experiences, and affordability that drives increased\nadoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, choice, and earning opportunity that\ncompetes effectively for their time.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale\nof our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that\nenable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants available,\nthe quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability. We believe that we are\npositioned favorably based on the combination of merchant selection, experience, and value we provide.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, and earnings potential. We believe that\nwe are well-positioned based on the limited requirements necessary to qualify, the density of our network, the\nimproving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\n1 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplace in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2021.\n6\nTable of Contents\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nIn the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Grubhub\n(acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in June 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants\nthat have their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems, other\nmerchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocery delivery services, traditional grocers, and\ncompanies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our\npresence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we\ncompete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that\nmerchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract\nconsumers. With Drive, and as we continue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete\nwith large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution\nhave allowed us to quickly extend our network and geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand\nwithin our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about\nthe risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nBusiness and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had over 8,600 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of\nour employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our\nemployee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2021, over 6 million people dashed 2 , earning a total of over $11 billion. Dashers worked an average\nof less than four active hours per week throughout the year.\nWe believe choice and access are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors,\nwe must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities as well\nas alternative uses of time like leisure. Because of this competition, we must provide earnings opportunities that\nare attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing\npositive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers-to-entry in dashing are very low. Prospective Dashers must pass a\nbackground check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car. People who qualify to become\nDashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We know of no other earning\nopportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around the other commitments they have in their lives, which often include full or\npart-time jobs, school, parenting or commitments to care for family or friends.\n2 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2021.\n7\nTable of Contents\nEarnings : Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with\nalternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of\nearnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by\nDashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur mission to grow and empower local economies creates a culture that promotes progress in all of our stakeholder\nrelationships. Just as importantly, our business cannot thrive, or even survive, without Dashers. As a result, our\nbusiness and financial ambitions are well aligned with our goal to make dashing an attractive and incremental\nearning opportunity that promotes social progress by giving people more choice in how they achieve their financial\ngoals.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ncities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the\ntalent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the\nvoices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources,\nand opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company.\nThe year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership\nteam, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nWomen’s Leadership Forum\nOur Women’s Leadership Forum equips mid- to senior-level technical women with skills to thrive in our workplace.\nThis six-month program happens once a year and includes classroom-style learning, one-on-one coaching, and group\nroundtables. Members of our management team actively participate in the forum.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have eight ERGs: Black@DoorDash, Latinx@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+),\nAAPI@DoorDash (Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), Veterans@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, and\nParents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2021, we had 250 issued U.S. patents, 53 U.S. patent applications pending, and 25 patent applications pending in a\nforeign jurisdiction. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of\nnew intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2021, we held 37 registered trademarks in the United States and\n73 registered\n8\nTable of Contents\ntrademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending\ntrademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names\nfor websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nIf Dashers in the United States are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply\nwith Proposition 22 in the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and failure by them to maintain their\nservice levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations,\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue,\nTotal Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline\nas the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane;\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n11\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or\nwaived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt’s future business and financial results could be\nnegatively affected;\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or\nliabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction; and\nOur and Wolt’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the\nTransaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt's results of operations, cash flows, and financial\nposition;\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\nhire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nAlthough we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net\nlosses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve profitability again, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $667\nmillion, $461 million, and $468 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, and, as\nof December 31, 2020, and 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. We\nexpect our costs will increase\n12\nTable of Contents\nover time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our\nbusiness and operating as a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial\nand other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring\nnew platform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and\nmarketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or\ngrowth in our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and\nother expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent\nbasis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, we\nhave $1.9 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity\nawards. Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate, growth in demand\nfor our offerings, and financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $885 million, $2.9 billion, and $4.9 billion,\nrespectively, representing a 226% and 69% year-over-year growth rate, respectively. In addition, with the COVID-19\npandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances\nthat accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to\ncontinue, and we expect growth in consumer demand and our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates\nto decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key\nbusiness metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key\nbusiness metrics, or key business metrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has\nfluctuated in prior periods. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and\ndecline in the long term. Our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020\nand 2021 as the size of our business grows and as we achieve higher market adoption rates. We may also experience\ndeclines in our revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors, including slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth\nopportunities, increasing regulatory costs, and the maturation of our business, among others. We also expect to\ncontinue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in increased\nrevenue or growth. In addition, we have strategically focused on suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas\nsince our founding because of the opportunity that these markets have presented for our local logistics platform.\nIf the demand for local logistics platforms does not continue to grow in these markets, or if we are unable to\nmaintain our category share in these markets, our revenue growth rate could be adversely affected. If our revenue\ngrowth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United\nStates, we compete with other local food delivery logistics companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (acquired by Just\nEat Takeaway in June 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have their own\nonline ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems, other merchants that own and\noperate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale\nsolutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with\nlarge Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google. Further, as\nwe continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these\nmarkets. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone,\nand paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local\npublications to attract consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult,\n13\nTable of Contents\nand if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to local food delivery logistics as we expect, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial\nresources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or\nemerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less\nattractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic\nmarket, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and\nsupply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less\nappealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic\nrelationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in\nDecember 2020, and Just Eat Takeaway, a European local logistics platform, acquired Grubhub in June 2021, and Lyft\nannounced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft’s loyalty-program members free delivery from Grubhub\nrestaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired kitchens to enable them to produce and deliver\nfood directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and\nperformance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours.\nAdditionally, many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission\nrates and consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and consumer\ndiscounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be more\nattractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission\nrates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain competitive,\nparticularly in markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be\nsuccessful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of\nfunding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These\ninvestments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to\nlower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more\neffectively against us. Delivery logistics services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are\nnascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to\ndevelop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIn addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift\nto the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local logistics platform, independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local logistics platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may\nadopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more\nhighly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our\nplatform. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from\nthe use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown\nin the past. In particular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide\nselection for consumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants\nand our national brand partners, or\n14\nTable of Contents\nconsumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect to continue to incur substantial\nexpenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire\nadditional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest\nsignificant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several\nyears or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately\nexceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may terminate\ntheir agreements with us by providing us at least seven (7) or thirty (30) days advance notice and such agreements\ndo not generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements\nwith us, the merchant selection available on our local logistics platform could be adversely affected. Changes to\nour business and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and\nretain other constituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership product, DashPass, and how\ncompelling this offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass.\nAdditionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as\ndiscounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such\nconsumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of DashPass, through\nprompts and notifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may\nnever convert to a paid membership to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions.\nIf we are not able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying\nconsumers, demand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than\nexpected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for\norders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, and access to Dasher Experience Centers where Dashers can\nreceive assistance with pressing issues, meet other Dashers, and participate in special events. If we do not\ncontinue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other\nincentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative\npublicity, or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, if\nmerchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to\nearn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers.\nWe also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these\nincentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or\ncould have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in\nincreased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our\ncontrol, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers\nthat utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in\neffect until terminated by Dashers or us. Dashers may terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least\nseven (7) days advance notice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers on\n15\nTable of Contents\nfavorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, or if Dashers terminate their\nagreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased\noperating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods to\nour consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand,\nproducing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience\nproblems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an\nincrease in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission\nrates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if\nmerchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide\nconsumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform.\nMany of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the\ncontrol of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit\ncosts, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on\nour platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “ Risk Factors ”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between Marketplace and Drive;\nthe proportion of consumers that are members of DashPass;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, particularly with respect to local food delivery logistics, including the effect\nof academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;\nour ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;\nthe effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and our order\nvolumes, as well as the impact of changes in the response of governments and private industry to COVID-19;\nthe impact that price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and\nany associated increase in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems\nare not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our\nbusiness interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions\nin our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nsystem failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as\na result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted.\nThese events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures\nin the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided\ncredits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar\nevent, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful,\nwould likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to\nidentify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as\nthe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel,\nand widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or recovery from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Factors that may\nimpact our business include:\nnew information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;\nthe duration and spread of the outbreak;\nthe severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary\nbusiness closures;\nregulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant\npricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;\nother business disruptions that affect our workforce;\nthe availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;\nthe continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;\nthe impact on capital and financial markets;\nactions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or\ntreat its impact, and;\npotential changes to consumer behavior or spending patterns as markets recover.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely, which may impact\nproductivity and otherwise disrupt our business operations. In addition, the current outbreak of COVID-19 has\nresulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and\nsimilar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and could in the future impact,\ndemand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and results\nof operations.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace\nGOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery\nand take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform. The circumstances that have accelerated the\ngrowth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue, and we expect\nour revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods compared to growth rates\nin 2020 and 2021.\nFurthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our\nemployees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any\ncontact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact\nmerchants’ ability to operate their businesses, consumers’ ability to pick up orders, and Dashers’ ability to make\ndeliveries during certain times, or at all. Viruses or other diseases transmitted by human contact may in the\nfuture cause a temporary closure of merchants’ businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary\npreventative measures, and many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their\nbusinesses, and may be forced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their\nbusinesses, many may operate with limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or\ndisruptions or closures of merchants’ businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our\nability to operate our local logistics platform, and adversely affect our business.\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived\nrisk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as\nunsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our\nplatform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar\npublic health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform\nwould be adversely affected. Any negative impact on consumers’ willingness or ability to order delivery or complete\na Pickup order, or on Dashers’ willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely\nto also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “ Risk Factors” section.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms will\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in California, have\nimplemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative\nproposals to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals\nto be made. In addition, some jurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco,\nCalifornia, New York, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two\njurisdictions’ price restrictions do not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging\nthe San Francisco and New York price controls as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction’s\npolice power. There are legislative proposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on food delivery\nlogistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made in the future. These price controls\nhave had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These\nprice controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers,\nthough we are aware of a few jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against doing so in\nconnection with price controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced demand for\nour services by consumers. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or\ncollect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as\nconfusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we\noperate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to\npersist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If\nany of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory\nscrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which\ncreates additional challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future\noffer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies\nthat enable them to attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be\nno assurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of\ndelivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further reduce the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and may in the future\nlaunch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as membership products like DashPass, and Dasher or consumer\nloyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are\npresented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants,\nconsumers, or Dashers or which may result in lower commissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For example, on April 27, 2021, we changed our merchant pricing\nmodels to better support certain U.S. restaurant partners, including by offering them a choice of three different\ndelivery commission rates tied to varying levels of marketing support and services. Further, our consumers’ price\nsensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to\ncompete effectively in these locations. In particular, our continued international expansion may require us to\nchange our pricing strategies and to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing\nand gratuities. While we do and will attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in\nthe technology used in our pricing and we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the\nservices on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.\nOur pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former\nDasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little\nor no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile,\nit also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being\nreceived by Dashers.\n19\nTable of Contents\nGovernment authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay model and may bring\nsimilar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection\nProcedures Act with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent\norder and judgment to resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former Dasher pay model\nfrom other government authorities in the future.\nThe incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to\nsome consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are\nable to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the\nfuture launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher\npay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and\ndesirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers\nwho meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and\npromotions.\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current\nDasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay\nmodel may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in\nearnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of\nfactors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any\nfuture changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an\nincrease to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been\ninvolved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc.v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June 2020.\nIn addition, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to\ndetermine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law by\nGovernor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex\nstandard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along\nwith certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative (“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5\nand preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in\nDecember 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court in California issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 have filed notices of appeal to the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings. Under Proposition\n22, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and\nDashers in California and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these\nincreased costs, we do in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower\norder volumes over time and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we\noperate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or\nother legislative processes in certain jurisdictions, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new\nprotections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other\nstakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt\nsuch legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives or other legislative processes in\ncertain jurisdictions, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could\nexperience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such\nlaws, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted. For example, we, along with certain other\ncompanies, app-based drivers, and community groups, are supporting a campaign for a 2022 ballot initiative in\nMassachusetts that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits for Dashers in\nMassachusetts. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California\nSuperior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior\nCourt’s order noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we\ncould face further challenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors\nas other states where we operate are considering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of\nDashers or delivery service providers using a local logistics platform as\n20\nTable of Contents\nemployees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher\nclassification, and to make other substantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an\nemployment position, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our\ngoals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term.\nThese decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the\nlong-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example,\nemployee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the\nUnited States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on\nmanagement and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our failure to implement and maintain effective\ninternal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that\ncould result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price of our\nClass A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in order to\nmanage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nA majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than twenty-four (24) months. We have made, and intend to\ncontinue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and sales and marketing\ninfrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies, and\nacquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial\ninfrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new employees,\nwhile maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to develop\nand improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures,\nrecruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not\nmanage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the efficiency of our\noperations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing\nour reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our\nmarketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to\nsuccessfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” mark, our logo, and other trademarks\nimportant to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe\nthat our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives\nnew consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our\nconsumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local logistics platforms and\nservices, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal\nto new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local logistics\nplatforms.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative\nperception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a\nresult of:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nDashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including Dasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay\nmodel, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security\npractices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely\naffect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and\nloyalty of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage\nrelated to the manner in which Dashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related\nto food tampering and general food safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and\nmerchants using our platform, which has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to\nscale and public awareness of our brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an\namplified negative effect on our reputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or\ninfluencers that we have partnered with may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to\nus. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ndata relating to our business, such as our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees. An\nincreasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large\nInternet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their\ninformation security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated\nand highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors’ platforms, vendors’\nsystems, or with our vendors’ personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website, platforms, and\nproprietary data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of breaches\nand other incidents. For example, in September 2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that\nresulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain Dashers’ driver licenses as well as data related to certain of\nour consumers. This incident has resulted in regulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this\nincident has not resulted in a material loss of revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken\nsteps to enhance our data security and governance program, which include adding additional protective security\nlayers around the data, improving security protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside\nexpertise to increase our ability to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of\nthe incident have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we\nmaintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our\ninsurance will be adequate to cover costs and liabilities related to this incident or to any incidents which may\noccur in the future. In addition, in December 2021, a vulnerability in a popular logging software, Log4j, was\npublicly announced. If left unpatched, the Log4j vulnerability could be exploited to allow unauthorized actors to\nexecute code remotely on a system using Log4j. We have taken steps to ensure these vulnerabilities have been\npatched in our systems, but we cannot guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been patched in every system upon\nwhich we are dependent or that additional critical vulnerabilities of Log4j or other open-source software upon\nwhich we rely will not be discovered.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or\nprevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors\nmay face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities\nused in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or\nthose of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our\nemployees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card\ninformation, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology, or IT,\nsystems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment\ninformation, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. Moreover, with many of our employees and\ncontractors and many employees and contractors of vendors currently working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe may be exposed to increased risks of security breaches or incidents.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to\nour systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are\nbecoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to\nidentify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve\ncredential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored\nor supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect,\nremediate, and otherwise respond to.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other\nsecurity breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past\nand cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to\ncyberattacks, viruses, social engineering, bugs, defects, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing,\nransomware and other malware and malicious code, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption or\ninterruption of such IT and infrastructure, or security breaches or incidents, and unauthorized parties may be able\nto access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers, our employees’ personal data, or our other sensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those\nsystems. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, there is a risk that these\npolicies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any actual or perceived\nsecurity breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable,\nresult in loss or improper access to, unavailability of, acquisition, disclosure, modification or other processing\nof, data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our\nrelationships with third-party partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and\nsignificant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such\nincidents or any perception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or\nDasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting any entities with\nwhich we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers and vendors) could\nhave similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security measures is limited. There have been and may\ncontinue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not\nbeen breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an\nincident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAlso, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our trade\nsecrets and other proprietary data. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December\n2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery\naddresses, to restaurant merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer opts out.\nFurthermore, this could result in certain consumers receiving unsolicited outreach from merchants as a result of\nthis data sharing, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this\nlaw, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the pendency of the litigation. If our\nlawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property or\nresult in harm to our reputation or brand. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security or privacy\nbreaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as\na whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect\nand prevent privacy and security breaches and other incidents, and we may face increased costs and expend\nsubstantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security breach or other incident.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any privacy or security breach or incident,\nregardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our\ninsurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any privacy or security breach or\nincident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that\nany insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims\nagainst us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for local food delivery logistics and our other delivery logistics services are still in relatively\nearly stages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow\nas large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe local food delivery logistics market has grown rapidly since we launched our local logistics platform in 2013,\nbut it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at\nall. In addition, the market for the other delivery logistics services we facilitate, such as grocery delivery\nservices, is also relatively nascent, and it is uncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other\ndelivery logistics services we may facilitate in the future will continue to grow and achieve wide market\nacceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt\nlocal food delivery logistics and the other delivery logistics services we facilitate. If the public does not\nperceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding safety,\naffordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform\nmay not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the\nactivities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which\ncould adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery,\ntheft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering\nDasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such\nactivities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments\nby consumers with insufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers\nof Dasher accounts by bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities\ninvolving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or\npayment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information,\nand mobile phone numbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal\nidentifying information to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this\nhas caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have\nlaunched a series of initiatives and products changes to help prevent these practices.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nactivities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through\nlitigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated\nfrom our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At\nthe same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and\ninadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable\nto implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the\ngrowth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be\nadversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal,\nimproper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which\nenables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are\nretained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in\nany of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on\n25\nTable of Contents\nour platform. Further, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our\nplatform or on our competitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of\nour industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers\nfrom non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally\nefficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants’\nsystems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does\nnot require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and\npay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each\norder, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we\nsometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that\noccur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated\nwith facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and\ncause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner\nmerchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed.\nWhile we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their\ninclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair\ncompetition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is\nalso a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the\nplatform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149 (“AB 2149”),\nwhich was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits,\namong other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California\nwithout the restaurants’ prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in jurisdictions where we\noperate including Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Arkansas, Virginia, Washington, DC, Nevada, Missouri, Oregon,\nRhode Island, New York, Colorado, and New Hampshire and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond\nregulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries\nfrom merchants without their prior consent. For example, in November 2020, we adopted internal policies pursuant to\nwhich we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our platform in the United States and\nsuch policies require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United\nStates to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with DoorDash. In the future, based on a variety\nof factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may continue to revise and update our internal policies\nrelated to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to remove non-\npartner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect our ability to attract and retain consumers and could\ndirectly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsite and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely\naffected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our\nfuture success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and\nupfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively,\nor we may fail to\n26\nTable of Contents\nadapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features\nand services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of\nour competitors.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability\nto scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local logistics platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our local logistics platform and\nwhile we continue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology,\nincluding enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our\nrouting and batching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the\nresulting gains in efficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the\ncost of our business and subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost\neffectiveness of our local logistics platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological\nimprovements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and\ncredits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform, including\nwith respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our\ngrowth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year, although\nour rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal fluctuations\ndifficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which may\nincrease consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which may decrease consumer demand. In addition, the number\nof available Dashers may decrease during periods of inclement weather, but consumer demand during these times may\nrequire us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these times, we typically rely on incentive pay\nto attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs. Further, severe\nweather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, and make it impossible for Dashers\nto make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In addition, we benefit from increased order\nvolume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is\nnot in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a similar decrease in Dasher pay.\nSeasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other\nseasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and\ncontribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we\nmay not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending and investment plans on\nforecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effects on consumer spending and merchant performance,\nmay adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the\nfactors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment,\nconsumer debt, reductions in net worth, inflation, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy\nprices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary\nitems may decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,\nwildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like some of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform cease operations, temporarily or\npermanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform. This risk is particularly\npronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in\nmarkets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for purchases from many of the merchants on\nour platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that any decline in consumer spending would\nhave a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses that sell products or services\nconsidered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines, consumers may be less likely\nto use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages at merchants could negatively impact their ability to\nfulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business. Inflationary\npressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand and drive lower order\nvolume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior\noperating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer\npreferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory\ndynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the\npool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new\nDashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our\nability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and\nretain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business\nmetrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in\nthe local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are\nunable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to\nadditional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. For example, we launched our platform in Canada in 2015, in\nAustralia in 2019, in Japan and Germany in 2021, and we expect to expand our international operations. particularly\nthrough the proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\"). Operating outside of the United States may require\nsignificant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and\ncustoms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations\nteams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a\nvariety of reasons, including:\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture\nacross all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data\nprivacy, data protection, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility and\ngeopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with\nrespect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIf we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or\nfail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected,\nchange our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than\nthose of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our\nindustry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous\nand drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies.\nWhile we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of\nsuch technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners’ autonomous or drone\ndelivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory\nscrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and\nprospects. Even if our or our partners’ efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are\nsuccessful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our\ncurrent costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and\nAmazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through\ncollaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local logistics\nindustry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale before we or\nour partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before we do, or\ntheir technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may be able to leverage\nsuch technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery logistics services, these competitors could\noffer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a\nsignificant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous\nand drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the\ncommercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our\nplatform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these\ntechnologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners’ ability to design and manufacture new\nautonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote\npilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature\ncontinue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing\nor new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial\nfines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,\nincluding acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that\ncomplement our business. For example, in November 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt, a\nlocal commerce platform based in Finland, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022. We have previously\nacquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result, there is no\nassurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate substantial\nrevenue.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our\nability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired\ncompany;\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\n30\nTable of Contents\ndifficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired\ncompany;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition\nopportunities;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or\ntechnology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue\nrecognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired\ncompany or business;\nrisks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in\nOctober 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private company based in Europe which\nprovides an instant grocery delivery service. Strategic investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control\nover business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or\ncompliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on\npartners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have\nbusiness interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or\nother actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who\ncontrol them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against\nus, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our\ninvestments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with\nforeign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign\ndirect investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to\nregulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and\nthus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy. In addition, our investments are speculative in\nnature and may decline in value or be entirely lost.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail\nto successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we\n31\nTable of Contents\nbelieve we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and\nexisting employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this or other\nreasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of our\nemployees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public\nmarkets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of\ncash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit,\ntrain, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We\nmay operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal,\naccounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and\nplace significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with\n32\nTable of Contents\nthe SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms\nand that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to\nour principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such\nprocesses and controls. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address this material weakness, we hired\nadditional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence personnel and implemented process level and\nmanagement review controls to identify and address emerging risks. While we believe this material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material\nweaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any\ndifficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to\nfail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior\nperiods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting\nfirm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are\nrequired to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC commencing with this annual report on\nForm 10-K. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also\ncause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a\nnegative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet\nthese requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAdditionally, commencing with this annual report on Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm is\nrequired to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the\nlevel at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to\nmaintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect\non our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\noverwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not\nreturn to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that\nwe do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our\ntechnology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n33\nTable of Contents\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and\naccess or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in\nexposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We\nmay need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any\nsuch errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax\nwithholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued\nwith respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may include cash generated from the\nproceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have the holders of such RSUs use a broker or brokers to\nsell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement date, with the proceeds of such sales to\nbe delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in order to satisfy such tax withholding and\nremittance obligations, or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker,\nsufficient to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such\nRSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common\nstock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates\non behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash. If we withhold shares of our Class A common\nstock that would otherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax\nauthorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We\nhave implemented “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market\nvalue equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and\nsettlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the\ntaxing authorities. Such sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax\nwithholding obligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the\ntax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number\nof shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-\nGAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools\nthat are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics\npublished by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our\ninternal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may\nchange over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly\ndisclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\ncontain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there\nare inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy\nof our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there\nare consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement\nmeasures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the\nnumber of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with\nrespect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could\naffect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if\ninvestors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification\nof Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an\nindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and\nregulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and\ndivergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We\nmaintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers may be reclassified\nas employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider classification and\ntheir potential impact on the local logistics industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service\nproviders as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nincluding as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as\nemployees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability\nto add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as\nindependent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have\nbarred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this\ncase. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn in December 2020. We believe we have meritorious\ndefenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In\naddition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis including claims raised\nunder PAGA and in 2022 we settled a similar classification matter covering Massachusetts and California Dashers\nincluding claims raised under PAGA.\nSome jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine\nworker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin\nNewsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding\ncontractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other\ncompanies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and\npreserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The\nCalifornia Attorney General and other groups and individuals have filed notices of appeal to the California Court\nof Appeal. As a result, to the extent\n36\nTable of Contents\nProposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings, as such, certain provisions regarding\ncompensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs\nrelated to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we do in certain\ncircumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on\nwhether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower\nNet Revenue Margin, which we previously referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed\nas a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us\ninclude, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to\nDashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (B)\nfor Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation after 2021)\nand (ii) for Dashers averaging at least fifteen (15) hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who\nsubscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts\ndepending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an adverse impact on our\nresults of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation\nthat would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in\nongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work\nthat Dashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related to\nDashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we\ncharge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of\noperations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could\nstill be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior\nCourt challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior Court’s\norder noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. Furthermore, if Dashers are\ndetermined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in even higher increases to our\ncosts related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions even more and may result in\nfurther lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under other state or federal law,\nwe would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations, which would have an adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses\nfor legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our\nbusiness generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims\nrelated to food offerings, delivery, and quality.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal,\nregulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage,\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer\ncomplaints, intellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to consumers and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits,\ngovernment investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we\nsometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the\nuncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we\nface increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic\nbeverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of,\nany consumers, Dashers, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal\nclaims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the\nfuture as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The\npotential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if such an event\noccurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform\ncould be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to\n37\nTable of Contents\nensure compliance with a food recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering,\nor inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants\nthat are not on our platform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry,\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nservice fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background\ncheck process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In\naddition, we also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating\nto, among other things, our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales\ntax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery logistics services we facilitate,\ndiscrepancies between the menus on our website and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from\nwhich the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such\nitems, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsite and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These\nproceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or\nother orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual\nand other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial\npartners and current and former directors and officers.\nIn addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation\nprocess for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in\nstate or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class\naction waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been\nthe subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may\nlimit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory\nproceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit\ncertain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or\nall of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised\nto exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in\npart, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental\n38\nTable of Contents\nstatutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet\nand e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as\na result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax\ndetermination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to\nlocal logistics businesses generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the\nUnited States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada and Australia, and we may face various\nindirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit\nindirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation,\nreporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently\ndo so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful\nassertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not\ncurrently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result\nin substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the\nappropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally,\nif merchants try to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline.\nAlthough we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if\nthese liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition would be harmed.\nUnder state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of\ngoods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,\nor other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past\nsales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our\nplatform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted\nlaws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting\nor collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new\nlegislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated\nwith tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less\nattractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee taxpayer\ninformation and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a failure to\ncomply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a percentage of\nthe amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to the large number\nof Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these reporting\nobligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy such\nfailures in a timely manner.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAs we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign\ntaxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as\nthe jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of us or the applicable subsidiary as well as the jurisdiction\nfrom which such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable\ndomestic or non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our\noperations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes\nand sales taxes are described in more detail under “ — If Dashers in the United States are reclassified as\nemployees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected .” and “ — Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or\nremitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or\nwithholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations,\nor inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ”\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative developments may also arise from the proposed U.S. tax reform under the\nBiden Administration, which has proposed a new corporate alternative minimum tax and increased taxation of\ninternational business operations. There is uncertainty regarding what changes, if any, will be enacted and the\neffect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated $4,125 million and $3,265 million of federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards, (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to\nexpire in 2036 for federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income\nin time to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability\nto use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income\nmay be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds fifty (50) percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may\napply under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards,\nto reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership\nchanges and ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will\ndetermine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of\nNOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help\ncounter the fiscal impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen\nreasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and\nother tax attributes.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe local delivery logistics industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards\ngoverning issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers on our platform more generally (for\nexample, those concerning Dasher pay, insurance requirements, and other aspects of our relationship with Dashers),\nlabor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products,\nonline credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, membership services, intellectual\nproperty, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks, website and mobile\napplication accessibility, and tax are\n40\nTable of Contents\noften complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of\nspecificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain\nand may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between state and federal law, between\nindividual states, and even at the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may\nchange or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been\nproactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available\nbroadly in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also\nlikely that as our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, as with\nour November 2021 launch in Germany, we would become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.\nIt is difficult to predict how existing laws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may\nbecome subject.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses\nlike ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in\nCalifornia, have implemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, some\njurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York,\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two jurisdictions’ price restrictions\ndo not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging the San Francisco and New York price\ncontrols as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction’s police power. There are legislative\nproposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we\nexpect other such proposals to be made in the future. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to\nhave in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may\nin the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of multiple jurisdictions\nwhich have adopted explicit limits or prohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls, which could\nfurther increase our costs. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or\ncollect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as\nconfusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we\noperate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to\npersist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If\nany of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory\nscrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which\ncreates additional challenges to managing our business.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our\nbusiness model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their\ntrade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the\nlegal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to\nchange such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the\nability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or\nregulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that\nwe may not be able to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement\nnew measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to\ndiscontinue certain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings,\nfines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement\nactions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative\nproposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred\nto prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws\nand regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other\nanticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government\nofficials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any\nimproper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address\ncompliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of\nour policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating\nthese laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign\njurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money\nlaundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of\nsignificant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment\nfrom U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or\noverall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws\nspecifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce,\nor other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business\npractices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue\nto evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content,\ncopyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts\nand other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and\nquality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and\nother taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to\nexpand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our\nmobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any\nfailure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our\nreputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as\nother personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and\ninternational laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and\nprotection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal\nInformation Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and\nMarketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, Australia’s Privacy Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (the “GDPR”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”). Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). These laws, rules, and regulations evolve\nfrequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and\nchanges in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires disclosures\nto California consumers, imposes obligations on businesses that process California consumers' personal information,\nand\n42\nTable of Contents\naffords such consumers new rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The\nCCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation as well as a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches that result in the loss of personal information, which could increase the likelihood of, and risks\nassociated with, data breach litigation.\nThe CCPA continues to evolve and could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and expose\nus to further regulatory or operational burdens. Also, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was approved\nby California voters and significantly modifies the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and likely requiring us\nto incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA has created obligations relating to\npersonal information as of January 1, 2022, Other states have also enacted or proposed similar privacy laws. For\nexample in March 2021, Virginia enacted a Consumer Data Protection Act that will go into effect January 1, 2023,\nand Colorado enacted a Colorado Privacy Act that will go into effect July 1, 2023. Both of these laws differ from\nthe CPRA, Similar laws are being considered by other state legislatures. This legislation and other proposed laws\nmay add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional\ninvestment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of data and could result in\nincreased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies. In addition, all 50 states have laws\nincluding obligations to provide notification of security breaches involving personal data to affected individuals,\nstate officers and others.\nMoreover, we will become subject to additional countries’ privacy laws as we expand our international operations.\nFor example, with our November 2021 launch in Germany, we became subject to the GDPR, which imposes strict\nrequirements relating to the processing of personal data. European Union (\"EU\") member states have enacted\nlegislation that adds to or interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential\nliability for failing to meet such obligations. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal\ndata subject to the GDPR to the United States as well as other countries that have not been found to provide\nadequate protection to such personal data. The GDPR also afford greater control for data subjects (for example, the\n“right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for data subjects, and data breach notification requirements.\nNoncompliance is subject to significant penalties, which can include fines of up to the greater of €20 million or\n4% of total worldwide revenue and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Such penalties are in\naddition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects.\nIn addition to laws and regulations, we are subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data\nSecurity Standard, which requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder\ninformation. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or\nconsequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, information security or consumer protection or any loss, unavailability or inadvertent or unauthorized\nuse, modification, disclosure, or other processing of data that we store or handle as part of operating our\nbusiness.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data\nprotection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or\ncontractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA, CPRA and GDPR imposing new and\nrelatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of\nthese and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary\nchanges to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect and use data about and relating to\nDashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is\nfurther restricted, regulated or blocked, the amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would\ndecrease, which could harm our business and results of operations. Federal, state, and foreign governmental\nauthorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the practice of online tracking for\nbehavioral advertising and other purposes. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted, have considered, or are\nconsidering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals\nto engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a\ncompany can employ electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. For example, the European\nCommission has proposed a draft regulation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the\n“ePrivacy Regulation”), which would replace the current ePrivacy Directive. If adopted, the earliest date for entry\ninto force is in 2023, with broad potential impacts on the use of Internet-based services and tracking\ntechnologies, such as cookies. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy\nRegulation and national implementation laws once they are enacted . In addition to the EU, other regulators are\nincreasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. For\nexample, the CCPA grants California consumers the right to opt-out of a company’s sharing of personal information\nfor advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration. Moreover, some providers of\nconsumer devices and web browsers have implemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking\ntechnologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted,\nsignificantly reduce the\n43\nTable of Contents\neffectiveness of such practices and technologies. For example, Apple introduced an iOS update in April 2021 that\nallowed users to more easily opt-out of tracking activity across devices, which has impacted and may continue to\nimpact business. As a result, we may have to develop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior,\ncustomize their online experience or efficiently market to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform\ncould be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors or merchants on our platform, to comply with applicable\nlaws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any\ncompromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data or other data\nrelating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure\nor compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing Dashers and consumers from\nusing our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims\nand litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our\nreputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities\nor claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text\nmessages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we\nbecome liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") are subject to interpretation by\nthe FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A\nchange in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations\nand could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May\n2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers\n(Topic 606)” (“ASC 606”), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC 842”), which increases lease transparency and\ncomparability among organizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles\nor our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance\ncoverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability,\nemployment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving\nservices, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services,\nand we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain.\nAdditionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related\nclaims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of\ninsurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of\nthese merchant agreements.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\nretentions, or\n44\nTable of Contents\notherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many\nbusinesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may\ndecide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or\nthe number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience a\nclaim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we\nexperience a claim for which coverage is not provided or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-\ninsured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers. Under our commercial\nagreement with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship with advanced notice. If Stripe terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be\nrequired to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment\nprocessor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and services provided by Stripe may not meet our\nexpectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these\nrisks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely\npayments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our\nplatform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nNearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services,\nwhich subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws\nand regulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering,\nmoney transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable\nregulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or\ncriminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other\npayment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely\non data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nFurther, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to\ncertain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and\nnumerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may\nhave a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we\ncould be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial\nservices, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are\nsubject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we\nare not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more\njurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply\nwith applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or\ncompliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain\nservices to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment\nprocessor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these\nrules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services\n(“AWS”), a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the\nfacilities of AWS that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,\ncybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s\ncontinuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and\ncapacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the\nrequirements of users on our platform. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to\nour success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become\nincreasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand\nand the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our\nreputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events\nmay harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-\nterm loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the\nagreement for convenience by providing us at least thirty (30) days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the\nagreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a\n30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even\nthough our platform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a\nshort period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.\nHowever, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers\nwould cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal\nand/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are\nnot qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be\nadversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the\nrequirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to\nfind an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\ntimeframe. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check\nprovider for these jurisdictions. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms\nacceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less\nattractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further,\nif the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise\nmeet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we\nmay be unable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified\nDashers may be inadvertently excluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction\nthat should have excluded him from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check\nproviders, and as a result, we allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to\ncause personal injury to a merchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation\nand brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In\naddition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we\nmay not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our\nplatform. In addition, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet\nthe requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.\n46\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related\nto notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be\nlimited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail\nto conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of\neligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all\nmapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping\nfunctions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of\nour third-party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its\nrelationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our\nplatform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software\nthat we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software\non terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such\nsoftware, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or\ninferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as\nGoogle Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are\nconstantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with\nthird-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our\nplatform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or\nexert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nAs our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our\ncompetitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that\ndegrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n47\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such\napplication marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce\nthe effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial\nresults, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any\nchanges in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ applications could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile\ndevices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our\napplications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our\napplications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify\ntheir search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such\nmobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our\nuser growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar\nfluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will\ncontinue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to\ndeliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range\nof mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers,\nor Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile\ndevices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth\nand user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements\nfor consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency\nframework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. These changes have, and we expect that these\nchanges will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will\nlimit our visibility into the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the\neffects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from\nexisting consumers on our platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in\nsearch results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is\ndue in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search\nengine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced\nfluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any\nreduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-\nparty sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources\nor the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate. Also, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law which went\ninto effect in December 2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, emails\nand delivery addresses, to restaurants merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer\nopts out. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against\nus during the pendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an\nadverse effect on our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our\nability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade\nname or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not\ntimely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property.\nOur efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of\n49\nTable of Contents\nthese claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our\nfavor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Further, an adverse\noutcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we\nare found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease making, licensing, or using\nproducts that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development\nresources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order\nto obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable\non terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license intellectual property which would\nrequire us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are\nresolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them\ncould adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses,\nbe required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software\nlicense. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and\nultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the\naffected portions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial\ntime, and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our\nsoftware until we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\n50\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. We believe our working capital will be sufficient to meet our\nanticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve (12) months and beyond. From time to time, we may\nseek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our\nongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we\nissue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We\nevaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other\nthings, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the capital\nmarkets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us,\nif at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require\nit, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2021,\nthere were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\n51\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of DoorDash Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has twenty (20) votes per share, and our\nClass C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. The Co-Founders together hold all\nof the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2021, Tony Xu, our co-founder,\nChief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer\nEngineering, and a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a\nmember of our board of directors collectively held 66% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in\naggregate, which voting power may increase over time as the Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity\nawards (including those equity awards granted to the Co-Founders prior to the IPO and subject to equity exchange\nright agreements whereby each of the Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any\nshares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or\nthe vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of\nClass B common stock). If all such equity awards held by the Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had\nbeen exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2021, the Co-Founders\nwould collectively hold 76% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. The Co-Founders have also entered\ninto the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and\nvote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and\npermitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will\nbe able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including\nthe election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,\nand the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major\ncorporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you\ndisagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,\npreventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to\nreceive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market\nprice of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause\nconflicts of interest between the Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking,\nor causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or the Co-Founders but would not be\ndesirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among the Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one (1) share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed\nby our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the first\ndate on which the number of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible\ninstruments, held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B\ncommon stock held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of the IPO, which\nwe sometimes refer to herein as the “35% Ownership Threshold”; (ii) twelve (12) months after the death or permanent\nand total disability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted\nas directed by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one\n(61) days and no more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no\nless than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer\nproviding services to us as an officer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board\nof directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr.\nXu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We\nrefer to the date on which such final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the\nterms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation occurs as the “Final Conversion Date”.\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually\n52\nTable of Contents\nresult in the Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower. Once the Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer\nhave the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for\na vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no voting rights (except as required by\nlaw), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the voting\ncontrol of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay the\nfinal conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued to\nMr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our voting power and\nhis ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our\nstockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to the Co-Founders and, in that event,\nthey would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without\ndiminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to\napproval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\").\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, the Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2021, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of\nthe voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a\n“controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange\nregarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\nadvisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment\nof no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices\nand in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in\nits indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under\nsuch announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain\nindices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds,\n53\nTable of Contents\nand other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock.\nThese policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of\npublicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as\ncompared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive\nstrategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude\ninvestment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a\nresult, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors, such as\nour announcement of the pending acquisition of Wolt;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we previously filed a registration statement to register\nshares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction\nof applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of\noutstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “ Voting Threshold\nDate ”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended\nor approved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain\n55\nTable of Contents\ncircumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class\nA common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common\nstock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. Nothing in our amended and restated bylaws precludes\nstockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject\nto applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition of Wolt\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or\nwaived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt’s future business and financial results could be\nnegatively affected.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOn November 9, 2021, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Wolt. Our and Wolt’s obligations to\nconsummate the Transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. These conditions\ninclude, among other customary conditions, receipt of certain specified regulatory approvals, the absence of\ncertain laws or orders prohibiting or making illegal the Transaction, effectiveness of the registration statement\non Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844) registering the shares of our Class A common stock issuable to the Wolt\nshareholders and holders of outstanding and unexercised vested options to purchase shares of Wolt class A common\nstock (\"Wolt Vested Optionholders\", jointly referred to as \"Seller\") as consideration in the Transaction, approval\nof a prospectus under Finnish law by the Finnish authorities, if required pursuant to applicable laws, execution of\nan escrow agreement by the parties and an escrow agent related to the escrow of certain shares to secure the\nSellers’ indemnification obligations, no event occurring that had or would reasonably be expected to result in a\nDoorDash Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)) or a Wolt Material\nAdverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)), compliance by the parties with their\ncovenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, dated November 9, 2021 (the \"Share Purchase Agreement\") in all material\nrespects, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by us or Wolt, and certain conditions related to key\nemployees and the lockup agreements entered into by certain Wolt stockholders (the “Lockup Agreements\").\nIn addition, if the Transaction is not completed by the termination date specified in the Share Purchase Agreement,\nor certain other events have occurred that prevent the closing conditions from being satisfied, either we or Wolt\nmay choose to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement. We or Wolt may also elect to terminate the Share Purchase\nAgreement in certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Share Purchase\nAgreement at any time prior to the closing of the Transaction. There is no assurance that the Transaction will be\nconsummated.\nIf the Transaction is delayed, terminated or otherwise not completed, DoorDash and Wolt would not realize any of\nthe expected benefits of the Transaction and may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our or\nWolt’s business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:\nunder certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of €210 million;\nDoorDash and Wolt will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the Transaction, including, as\napplicable, professional fees and expenses, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices, and other\ntransaction-related costs, fees and expenses. These costs are payable by DoorDash and Wolt whether or not the\nTransaction is complete. If the Transaction is not completed, DoorDash and Wolt will have incurred substantial\nexpenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received by DoorDash or Wolt;\nmatters related to the Transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and\nresources by our and Wolt’s management teams and numerous others throughout our and Wolt’s organizations, which\ncould otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;\nwe may acquire a majority but less than all of the outstanding shares in the Transaction, which may result in\nobligations to the minority shareholders of Wolt or additional expenses and obligations in connection with, and\nfollowing, the Transaction;\nDoorDash and Wolt may be subject to legal proceedings related to the Transaction or the failure to complete the\nTransaction, which could be time consuming and expensive, could divert DoorDash's and Wolt’s managements’ attention\naway from their regular business and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against DoorDash or Wolt, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their financial condition;\na delay in completing the Transaction, or failure to complete the Transaction, negative perceptions about the\nTransaction, or other factors beyond DoorDash’s and Wolt’s control, may result in negative publicity and a negative\nperception of DoorDash and/or Wolt in the investment community, and could negatively impact on our stock price; and\nany disruptions to our or Wolt’s businesses resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transaction,\nincluding any adverse changes in DoorDash’s or Wolt’s relationships with their respective customers, suppliers,\npartners or employees, may continue to intensify in the event the Transaction is not consummated.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or\nliabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt with us may pose special risks, including write-offs or restructuring\ncharges, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the integration will be\naccomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the Transaction and the integration of Wolt will\nsubject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction,\nsome of which may be unknown.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt and we have certain rights of\nindemnification, including the escrow of shares to secure the Sellers’ obligations, there can be no guarantee that\nwe are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or that the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow\nconsists of shares and therefore, even if we are able to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and\nresources to pay for the liabilities and damages. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties\nrelated to the transaction not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur,\ncould negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our profitability.\nFurther, Wolt’s business is different in certain ways from ours, and our results of operations may as a result be\naffected by factors that differ from those currently affecting our results of operations.\nOur and Wolt’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the\nTransaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt’s results of operations, cash flows and financial\nposition.\nParties with which we and Wolt do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Transaction, including\nwith respect to current or future business relationships with us, Wolt or the combined company following the\ncompletion of the transaction. Our and Wolt’s relationships may be subject to disruption as merchants, Dashers and\ncouriers, and other persons with whom we and/or Wolt have a business relationship may have concerns about a larger,\nmore international organization, or otherwise, and may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to\nseek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Wolt, as applicable, or consider entering\ninto business relationships with parties other than us or Wolt. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on\nthe results of operations, cash flows and financial position of us, Wolt or the combined company following the\ncompletion of the transaction, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected benefits of the\ntransaction. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of\nor failure to complete the transaction.\nUncertainties associated with the Transaction may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and\nDoorDash and the combined company may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key\nemployees, which could adversely affect the future businesses and operations of DoorDash and the combined company.\nDoorDash and Wolt are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective management personnel\nand other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company’s success after the completion of the\nTransaction will depend in part upon the ability of DoorDash and Wolt to attract, motivate and retain key\nmanagement personnel and other key employees. Prior to completion of the Transaction, current and prospective\nemployees of DoorDash and Wolt may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following\nthe completion of the Transaction, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of DoorDash and Wolt to\nattract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given\nthat DoorDash will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees of DoorDash\nand Wolt to the same extent that DoorDash and Wolt have previously been able to attract or retain their own\nemployees. If key employees terminate their employment, DoorDash’s business activities may be adversely affected\nand management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating DoorDash and Wolt to hiring suitable\nreplacements, all of which may cause DoorDash’s business to suffer.\nWolt is subject to numerous legal and regulatory regimes and the combined business could be harmed by changes to,\nor the interpretation or the application of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates.\nWolt is also subject to a number of legal and compliance risks, and these risks may adversely affect the combined\ncompany after completion of the Transaction. Wolt operates in twenty-three (23) countries in Europe and Asia,\nincluding, among others, Japan, Finland, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and Israel. The international scope of Wolt’s\nbusiness requires us to comply with a wide range of EU-level, national and local laws and regulations, which may in\ncertain cases diverge from or even conflict with each other.\nWolt’s business principally consists of providing an online delivery logistics platform and enabling people to get\nthe same Wolt delivery experience from virtually any type of merchant (which in the case of Wolt includes, among\nothers, restaurants, grocery stores, retail shops or boutiques), including operating its own Wolt Market grocery\nstores. With the geographic expansion of DoorDash’s business and that of its subsidiaries, including also Wolt\nafter the consummation of the Transaction, into new markets, DoorDash will become subject to additional and\nchanging legal, regulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards with respect to\ndelivery logistics providers.\n58\nTable of Contents\nIn countries where DoorDash and Wolt operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new\ninterpretations of existing laws and regulations or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning the\nbusiness of DoorDash and/or Wolt, e.g., the independent contractor model for couriers. Changes in government\nregulation of or successful challenges to the independent contractor model used by Wolt in certain markets may\nrequire Wolt to change its existing business models and operations.”). Any additional regulatory scrutiny or\nchanges in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for the combined\ncompany to continue to operate in all of the current markets or to expand in accordance with our strategy,\nparticularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different operating\ncountries. This may negatively impact Wolt’s or our revenue and profitability by preventing our or Wolt’s business\nfrom reaching sufficient scale in particular markets or having to change its business model or incur additional\ncosts, which would adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction. Our inability, or\nperceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to regulatory scrutiny,\nwhich could result in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable\nundertakings and adversely affect the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in competitive pressure from both\nexisting competitors and new entrants in the already highly competitive food delivery logistics industry.\nAs a result of the Transaction, DoorDash, through the operations of Wolt, will operate in a greater geographical\narea than it does currently. A number of competitors both in Europe and Asia offer food delivery logistics services\nsimilar to those offered by DoorDash and Wolt. Existing competitors and new entrants in this space in Europe and\nAsia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior offerings or consolidate with other\nentities and achieve benefits of scale. Such competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may\nmaterially erode Wolt’s existing market share and negatively impact Wolt’s revenue, and may hinder Wolt’s expansion\ninto new markets, which could adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nFollowing the completion of the Transaction, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will\nbe increased.\nWe are currently subject to some foreign currency exchange risk because we conduct business operations in several\nforeign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which conduct business in their respective local\ncurrencies. Wolt conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States through its\nsubsidiaries or affiliates, which also operate in their respective local currencies, the most significant of which\nare currently the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Israeli Shekel. Therefore, following the completion of the\nTransaction, our international operations will account for a more significant portion of our overall operations\nthan they do presently and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase. Because\nour financial statements will continue to be presented in U.S. dollars subsequent to the completion of the\ntransaction, the local currencies will be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for\ninclusion in our consolidated financial statements, thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe may be targeted by securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and\nmay delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have\nentered into share purchase agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can\nresult in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary\ndamages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff\nis successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Transaction, then that injunction may delay\nor prevent the Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Currently, neither we nor Wolt is\naware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the\nTransaction.\nThe Transaction may be completed even though a material adverse effect may result from the announcement of the\nTransaction, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either party can refuse to complete the Transaction if there is a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a\nWolt Material Adverse Effect (each as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) affecting the other party prior to\nthe closing. However, some types of changes that would result in a material adverse effect of either party are\nexcluded from the definitions of a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a Wolt Material Adverse Effect, and do not\npermit either party to\n59\nTable of Contents\nrefuse to complete the Transaction. If such adverse changes occur but we and Wolt still complete the Transaction,\nthe market price of our Class A common stock may suffer.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction, if, among other things, we\nare unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost\nsavings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the Transaction are not realized, or if the transaction\ncosts related to the Transaction are greater than expected. The market price may also decline if we do not achieve\nthe perceived benefits of the Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by investors or financial or\nindustry analysts or if the effect of the Transaction on our financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows is not consistent with the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts. The issuance of\nshares of our Class A common stock in the Transaction could on its own have the effect of depressing the market\nprice for our Class A common stock. In addition, many Wolt shareholders and Wolt Vested Optionholders may decide\nnot to hold the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the Transaction. Other Wolt\nshareholders and Wolt Vested Optionholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in\nindividual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the\nTransaction. Any such sales of our Class A common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for\nour Class A common stock. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on\nthe market for, or liquidity of, the our Class A common stock, regardless of the actual operating performance of\nthe combined company.\nCompletion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment or other provisions in certain agreements\nto which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business\nand results of operations.\nThe completion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment and other provisions in certain\nagreements to which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party. If DoorDash and Wolt are unable to negotiate waivers of,\nor consents under, those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the\nagreements, potentially terminating the agreements, seeking monetary damages or other remedies. Even if DoorDash\nand Wolt are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to\nrenegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to DoorDash. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may\nhave an adverse impact on the businesses, financial condition and results of operations of DoorDash following the\ncompletion of the transaction, or the ability to successfully integrate their respective businesses and/or execute\ntheir respective strategies."

                "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, delivery providers, or other third parties (individually or as\nclass actions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\n60\nTable of Contents\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of third-party delivery providers on our\nplatform as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various\nlabor and other laws that would apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nclassification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of third-party delivery providers on our platform as independent contractors.\nIn November 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed\ncertain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging\nworker misclassification of Dashers, or the Marciano settlement. These actions were filed by and on behalf of\nMassachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco on November 21, 2019. In April 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with\nthe filed settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. In June 2020, the parties\nsubmitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. The amended settlement agreement\nincreased the total amount to be paid by us from $40 million to $41 million. In June 2020, the court issued a\ntentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed amended settlement agreement and requesting supplemental\nbriefing from the parties. In July 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement\nagreement to the court. In August 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for\npreliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice and inviting the parties to file supplemental\nbriefing addressing the concerns raised by the court. In October 2020, we entered into an amended settlement\nagreement to increase the total amount to be paid by us from $41 million to $89 million. In November 2020, the\nparties submitted supplemental briefing and the amended settlement agreement to the court. In February 2021, the\ncourt issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement\nwithout prejudice. In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a notice of withdrawal of the motion for preliminary approval of\nthe settlement. In light of the court’s concern about the plaintiffs releasing various class claims that were not\noriginally pled in the Marciano action (which was filed as a PAGA-only case), the parties agreed not to seek a\nrelease of these claims in Marciano, but to instead present a new proposed settlement in Marko v DoorDash, Inc.,\nCase No. BC659841 (Los Angeles Super. Ct.), where the court had jurisdiction over the various class claims under\nthe Labor Code encompassed by the agreement. In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a revised settlement agreement with\nthe Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, or the Marko settlement. The total amount to be paid by us\nis $100 million. In January 2022, the court granted final approval of the Marko settlement which resolves claims\nunder PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016\nthrough December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period\nof September 26, 2014 through March 31, 2021.\nMore than 35,000 delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed or expressed an\nintention to file arbitration demands against us that assert worker misclassification claims. As of December 31,\n2021, individual settlement agreements have been executed and amounts paid thereunder, in an aggregate amount of\napproximately $83 million, including attorneys’ fees, and covering approximately 31,000 delivery providers. We do\nnot admit any allegations of wrongdoing as part of the resolution of these matters.\nVarious other delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their\nclassification on our platform, as an independent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual delivery\nproviders, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our\nindependent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code\nand the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary\ndamages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to\n61\nTable of Contents\nclassify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however,\nthe possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia. New laws and\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in\nresponse to our industry and related technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was\nsigned into law in September 2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with\ncertain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to\naddress AB 5 and preserve flexibility for delivery providers, which passed in November 2020, and which became\neffective in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor\ngroups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County Superior Court to compel the State of California not\nto enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as unconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the\nAlameda County Superior Court issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The\nCalifornia Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of\nProposition 22 have filed notices of appeal to the California Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect\npending further court proceedings.\nIn addition, several other states where we operate may adopt legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we would\nexpect to increase our costs in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if we charge higher fees\nand commissions as a result of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the\npassage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have been and may in the future\nbe challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards\nsimilar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nthe Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, compliance\nwith consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation\ninsurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of\nthe State of California for payroll tax liabilities. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related\ngovernmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit,\nor inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly\nin the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or\nother action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs\nassociated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources,\nand other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\n62\nTable of Contents\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving delivery\nproviders who have been active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters\nrelated to accidents or other incidents involving delivery providers that utilize our platform. In many of these\nmatters, we believes we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or\nincidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and\nLegal Proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an\nadverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of\nmanagement resources, and other factors."

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in\nthe section titled “Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nIn addition, the section of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions\nof 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nPart II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC\non March 5, 2021.\nOverview\nWe have built a logistics and technology platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations\nof ease and immediacy. We built our products to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers. We do this primarily through our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable\nmerchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order\nfulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to\nestablish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can\nfulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by\nconsumers. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and\ndrive incremental sales.\n65\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services\nbusiness, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand\ngenerated through their own channels using our local logistics platform. Storefront enables merchants to create\ntheir own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand\naccess to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nWe currently operate our business in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and Germany.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at\nthe public offering price of $102 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares in\nthe IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. For additional information,\nsee Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt. Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland,\nWolt is a leading local commerce platform with operations in 23 countries across Europe, Japan, and Israel. We\nexpect the acquisition of Wolt will increase our international scale, accelerate our product development, and\nimprove our investment efficiency. The closing is expected in the first half of 2022, subject to customary\nregulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We expect the acquisition of Wolt to increase our Marketplace\nGOV and revenue, as well as our costs and expenses.\nOn February 14, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an ordering and payment platform company\ndomiciled in the United States for approximately $90 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The\ntransaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\nKey Business and Non-GAAP Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business\nand non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business\nplans, and make strategic decisions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except percentages)                              2019            2020            2021\nTotal Orders                                                    263             816           1,390\nMarketplace GOV                          $                    8,039       $  24,664       $  41,944\nContribution Profit (Loss)(1)            $                     -200       $     663       $   1,071\nContribution Margin(1)                                          -23  %           23  %           22  %\nContribution Profit (Loss) as a % of                             -2  %            3  %            3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                       $                     -475       $     189       $     289\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)                                       -54  %            7  %            6  %\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                            -6  %            1  %            1  %\nGOV\n(1) Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most\ndirectly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed\nthrough our Marketplace and Platform Services businesses, over the period of measurement.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Total Orders increased to 1.4 billion, or 70% growth compared to the year\nended December 31, 2020 . The increase in Total Orders was driven by increased engagement of existing consumers,\nthe addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Platform Services\nbusinesses.\n66\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplace,\nincluding taxes, tips 3 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass.\nMarketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not include\nthe dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through Drive and\nStorefront.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV increased to $41.9 billion, or 70% growth compared to the year\nended December 31, 2020, consistent with the growth in Total Orders.\nContribution Profit (Loss). 4 We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\nand (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is\ndefined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and\namortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a\npercentage of revenue for the same period.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nI n the year ended December 31, 2021, Contribution Profit improved to $1.1 billion, compared to a Contribution\nProfit of $663 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by the growth in Marketplace GOV. In\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, Contribution Margin decreased to 22%, compared to 23% in the year ended December\n31, 2020, due to increases in Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Dasher acquisition costs.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss)\nis not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is\nnot a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total\ncompany profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA. 5 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and\nregulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract\nrelated to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property\nand equipment, (iv) transaction-related expense, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii)\ninterest income and expense, (viii) other income (expense), net, (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that\nwe use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is\ncalculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $289 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $189\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020 , driven primarily by the growth in Marketplace GOV . In the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 6%, compared to 7% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due\nprimarily to increases in Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Dasher acquisition costs.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplace to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplace to arrange\nfor delivery services.\n3 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n4 For more information about Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin, including the limitations of such\nmeasures, and a reconciliation of Contribution Profit (Loss) to gross profit (loss), the most directly comparable\nfinancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n5 For more information about Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, including the limitations of such measures\nand more detail on the specific adjustments, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n67\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for both partner merchants and\nconsumers.

We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nbecause (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting\nor forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such\nexpenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative\nand regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 and similar legislation.\n(2) Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former\nheadquarters.\n(3) In connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, we committed\nto sell an existing investor shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock in a subsequent closing\nat the initial issuance price of the Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. We determined this commitment\nto be a forward contract, classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with changes\nin fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the\nconsummation of an IPO of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the\nfederal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants\nunder the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were drawn from the\ncredit facility.\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December\n31, 2020 and 2021, we had $66 million and $60 million of issued letters of credit outstanding, respectively, of\nwhich $44 million and $39 million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nConvertible Notes\n76\nTable of Contents\nOn February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the\nConvertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto, or\nthe Note Investors. We received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an\noriginal issue discount of $5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable\nquarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible\nNotes in full for $375 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of\nour Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $4.4 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.3 billion and long-term marketable securities of $650 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $320 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable\nsecurities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $2.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2021. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur material cash requirements relate to operating lease obligations for corporate office facility leases and\npurchase commitments for purchase of onboarding, technology platform infrastructure services and advertising\nservices. For Information on contractual obligations for operating leases, see Note 8 - Leases included in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on non-cancellable\npurchase commitments as of December 31, 2021, see \"Non-cancelable Purchase Commitments\" section of Note 10 -\nCommitments and Contingencies included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                     2019        2020         2021\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating    $                     -467    $    252    $     692\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                             -570        -192       -2,047\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing                         1,109       3,996         -483\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                —           2           -1\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash       $                       72    $  4,058    $  -1,839\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $692 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This consisted of a\nnet loss of $468 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $486 million, non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $156 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets\nand accretion of operating lease liabilities of $52 million, non-cash bad debt expense of $36 million, non-cash\ninterest expense of $11 million related\n77\nTable of Contents\nto the convertible notes, and other non-cash expenses of $28 million. The net changes in operating assets and\nliabilities was the result of an increase of $595 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities,\nprimarily related to Dasher and merchant payable, insurance reserves, accrued operations related expenses, contract\nliabilities, and accrued advertising, an decrease of $85 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and\nan increase of $79 million in accounts payable, offset by an increase of $174 million in funds held at payment\nprocessors, an increase of $94 in accounts receivable, net, a decrease of $44 million for payments for operating\nlease liabilities, an increase of $51 in other assets and an decrease of $5 million in other liabilities. The\nincrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 was mainly due to the decrease in net loss and increases in non-cash expenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nCash provided by operating activities was $252 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of a\nnet loss of $461 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $322 million, non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $120 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets\nand accretion of operating lease liabilities of $40 million, non-cash interest expense of $31 million related to\nthe convertible notes, non-cash bad debt expense of $16 million, and other non-cash expenses of $18 million. The\nnet changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase of $587 million in accrued expenses\nand other current liabilities, primarily related to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and\nindirect taxes, accrued operations related expenses, Dasher and merchant payable, and contract liabilities, an\nincrease of $54 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $11 million in other liabilities, offset by an\nincrease of $248 million in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $96 million in funds held at payment\nprocessors, an increase of $96 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a decrease of $26 million for\npayments for operating lease liabilities, and an increase of $20 million in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $2,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily\nconsisted of purchases of marketable securities of $2,344 million, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of\n$409 million, purchases of property and equipment of $129 million, and cash outflows for capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs of $108 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable\nsecurities of $944 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted\nof purchases of marketable securities of $593 million, purchases of property and equipment of $106 million, cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $53 million, and cash paid for acquisitions, net\nof cash acquired, of $28 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $587\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of $333\nmillion of repayment of the convertible promissory notes, $172 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to\nnet share settlement of equity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, partially offset by\n$32 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of\n$3.3 billion of proceeds from issuance of common stock upon our IPO, net of underwriter discounts, $382 million of\nnet proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, $333 million of net proceeds from the\nissuance of convertible promissory notes, and $5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by\n$7 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $6 million of\npayment of deferred offering costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\n78\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s\nproducts. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part\nof our Marketplace. Revenue generated from DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the\ncontractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the\nconsumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants\nthat use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their\nown channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products.\nOur local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have has determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplace. The consumer accesses the our local\nlogistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through its Marketplace. Those gift cards have no expiration\ndate and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to\nconsumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract\nliabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is\nrecognized on a net\n79\nTable of Contents\nbasis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and\nDashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed sufficient historical evidence\nregarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the portion of\noutstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit\nthe value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. We\nrecognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card\nredemptions. As a result of this change in estimate, we recorded $48 million of gift card breakage revenue during\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and\nhistorical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals : We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results\nmay differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if\nnew information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of\noperations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited\noperational history, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry\nclaim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected\nloss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information\nbecomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our\nreserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a\n80\nTable of Contents\nquarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our\ninternational businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening of the\nU.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\n81\nTable of Contents"

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n83\nTable of Contents\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance\nwhich include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury\nand physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was $143 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 1,

INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany provides a local logistics platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of\nease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the\nDoorDash Marketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting\nthem with consumers (the “Marketplace”). Merchants can fulfill this demand with independent contractors who use the\nCompany’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”). As part of the Marketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which\nallows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees,\nas well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company’s platform with large group orders and\ncatering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also includes DashPass, the Company’s membership\nproduct, which was formerly referred to the Company's subscription product, which provides consumers with unlimited\naccess to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the\nCompany offers Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive (\"Drive\"), a white-label logistics\nservice that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this\ndemand using the Company’s local logistics platform, and DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\") that enables merchants\nto create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers\non-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold\n33million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $ 102.00per share. The Company\nreceived net proceeds of $ 3.3billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock automatically converted into 239million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior\nto the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\nauthorizes a total of 6.0billion shares of Class A common stock, 200million shares of Class B common stock,\n2.0billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285million shares of the Company’s common stock were automatically\nreclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Reclassification”).\nImmediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31million shares of Class\nA common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for\nan equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a\nresult, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with both service-based and liquidity event-\nrelated performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company’s IPO, the Company\nrecognized $ 279million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs was settled and\ndelivered on June 7, 2021 (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date”). The future tax benefits on settlement of the\nabove RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to reduce\nits net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net\nshare settle, the Company withheld 65,058shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested\nRSUs and paid $ 7million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any\nincome tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to\nreceive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that accrued at the applicable federal rate. The short-\nterm loan extended to employees totaled\n91\nTable of Contents\n$ 10million, which was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of shares into the market on the IPO Vested RSU\nSettlement Date.\nStock Splits\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a five-for-one\nforward stock split of the Company’s common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock (collectively, the\n“Capital Stock”), which became effective on November 9, 2020. The authorized number of each class and series of\nCapital Stock was proportionally increased in accordance with the five-for-one stock split and the par value of\neach class of Capital Stock was not adjusted as a result of this forward stock split. All common stock, redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, warrants, and per share information presented within these\nconsolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this forward stock split on a retroactive basis for\nall periods presented.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 for revenue by geography. Long-lived assets, which consist of property\nand equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, located outside of the United States were $ 15million\nand $ 28million a s of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe period presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses,\ngift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development\ncosts, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments,\nvaluation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting,\ninsurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\n92\nTable of Contents\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash\nconsists of collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance\npolicies.As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the restricted cash balances were not material and were included in\nother assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits\nthe concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with maturities greater than three\nmonths, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with maturities greater than one year\nare included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable securities are classified as\navailable-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the\nCompany evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the\namortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically\nrelated to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nWhen a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the\ndebt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be\nrecorded. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was\nrecorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with\nmerchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company’s assessment of\nthe collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a\ncollective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay and\ncollection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\n93\nTable of Contents\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.Disposals were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Noimpairment charge was recorded in any\nof the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment.\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\nIn 2021, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity securities of $ 409million in cash for preferred\nshares of private companies including an investment of $ 395million in cash for preferred shares of a grocery\ndelivery platform company. All those investments were accounted for using the measurement alternative.\nThere are no adjustments or impairment associated with the Company’s non-marketable equity securities during 2021.\nThe Company does not have any realized or unrealized gains or losses on non-marketable equity securities as of and\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows.\n94\nTable of Contents\nAssets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized impairment charges of $ 11million and $\n1million, respectively, related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with its former headquarters,\nwhich the Company subleased to another company.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited\noperational history, the Company utilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward\nrelevant industry claim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement\npatterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience\ndevelops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which\ncould result in losses over the Company’s reserved amounts.During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,\nthe Company recorded additions to the insurance reserves of $ 12million, $ 63million and $ 134million,\nrespectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized\ngains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into U.S.\ndollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.\nPrior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting\ncondition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. The\nliquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the Company's IPO, and\nthe Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 279million as of the IPO date for those\nRSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the\nremaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will\nbe recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. Since November\n2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award (as discussed further in Note 12), the Company only granted\nRSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of\n95\nTable of Contents\na service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as defined below) that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award was\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the\nderived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the\nderived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative\nexpense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether\nthe stock price goals are achieved.\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying\ncommon stock. The Company’s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company’s common stock by\nconsidering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined\nbased on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net\namount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of\nfuture taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n96\nTable of Contents\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in funds held at\npayment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to\nDashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-\nauthorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering.As of December 31, 2020, three entities in dividually accounted for 20%, 14%, and 10% of accounts\nreceivable, net, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, two entities in dividually accounted for 15% and 14% of\naccounts receivable, net, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through the Marketplace and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of the Marketplace. Revenue generated from the Company’s\nDashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one monthto\none yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the Company also generates\nrevenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its local logistics platform\nto arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is\nrecognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\nlogistics platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local logistics platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore\n97\nTable of Contents\nconsidered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service\nand the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately.\nFurther, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature\nof the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually,\nrather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through the Marketplace. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal logistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplace. Those gift cards have no\nexpiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited\nhistory as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded\nas contract liabilities until consumers used the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that it\nhad developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have\nthe ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for\nwhich there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as\nunclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the\npattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. As a result of this change in estimate, the Company\nrecorded $ 48million of gift card breakage revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Estimating future\nbreakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage\nrates may vary from the estimate.\n98\nTable of Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local logistics platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 446million, $ 698million and $ 1.2billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common\nstockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating securities\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any\nremaining earnings would be\n99\nTable of Contents\ndistributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock pro rata on an as-\nconverted basis. These holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are not contractually\nobligated to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, the Company’s net losses were not allocated to these\nparticipating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock,\nClass B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly,\nthe Class A common stock and Class B common stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net losses. Noshares of\nClass C common stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Prior to the completion of the\nIPO, there were noshares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic\nnet loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not\nbeen settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company’s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred\nstock were automatically converted into 239million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified\ninto stockholders' (deficit) equity.As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there were noshares of redeemable convertible\npreferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, consulting, accounting, and other fees relating\nto the anticipated sale of the Company’s common stock in the IPO, were initially capitalized and recorded in other\nassets on the consolidated balance sheets.After the IPO, all deferred offering costs were reclassified into\nstockholders' (deficit) equity as a reduction of the IPO proceeds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from fourto five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no\nresidual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it\n100\nTable of Contents\nuses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for collateralization, current available yield curves,\nand the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\", which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for\nintra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition\nof deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the\naccounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for\ntransactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. For public business entities, this standard is\neffective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company adopted 2019-12 on January 1, 2021. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not\nmaterial to its consolidated financial statement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the\nprocess of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the update on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nThe following tables present the Company’s revenue disaggregated by offering and by geographical region.\nRevenue by offering was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019        2020        2021\nCore business    $                      876    $  2,886    $  4,888\nOther revenue                             9           —           —\nTotal revenue    $                      885    $  2,886    $  4,888\nCore business is primarily comprised of Marketplace, which includes Pickup and DoorDash for Work, and Drive.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the\naddress of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019        2020        2021\nUnited States    $                      877    $  2,875    $  4,877\nInternational                             8          11          11\nTotal revenue    $                      885    $  2,886    $  4,888\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nand merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over\ntime. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows\n(in millions):\n101\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nBeginning balance                             $                           108\nAddition to contract liabilities                                        1,212\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)(3)                             -1,137\nEnding balance                                $                           183\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplace. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 22million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n(3) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorde d $ 48million o f gift card breakage revenue,\nwhich represented the estimate of cumulative gift card breakage through December 31, 2021 based on the Company's\naccounting policy discussed in Note 2.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.

The\ntotal purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed,\nwhich primarily consisted of $ 22million of intangible assets. The intangible assets acquired consisted entirely of\nexisting technology, which has an estimated remaining useful life of 8years as of the date of the acquisition .\nAdditionally, the Company recorde d $ 10million of goodwill, which represented the excess of the purchase price\nover the net assets acquired.\nThis acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n5.

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2022 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. Lease\ncosts, net of sublease income, was $ 29million, $ 46million, and $ 66million during the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.\nIn June 2019, the Company subleased its previous headquarters office space to another company (the “Sublessee”).\nThe sublease required Sublessee to pay 100% of any rent and other related expenses due and payable under the\nexisting lease with the landlord (the “Head Lease”), however the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation\nto the landlord under the Head Lease. Accordingly, an operating lease liability and an operating lease ROU asset\nwas reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to the Head Lease. Prior to April 2020, all\npayments due and payable by Sublessee were made timely.\nIn early April 2020, as a result of a disruption to Sublessee’s business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sublessee\ninformed the Company that it would not be making any future monthly rent payments. Accordingly, the Company ceased\nrecognizing sublease income beginning in April 2020, and further determined that an impairment existed and\nrecognized an impairment charge of $ 11million and $ 1million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,\nrespectively, reducing the carrying value of the ROU asset to its estimated fair value. Fair value of the ROU asset\nwas estimated using an income-approach based on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the\nproperty based on current sublease market rent.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020       2021\nOperating lease cost     $                       22    $    40    $    52\nShort-term lease cost                            10         11         17\nSublease income                                  -3         -5         -3\nTotal lease cost         $                       29    $    46    $    66\n107\nTable of Contents\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2020            2021\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            10.7            9.77\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  8.06%           6.81%\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       32    $    46\nleases\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                       69    $   164\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 120million and $ 19million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced. Such leases are not\nincluded in the operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future minimum lease payments required under operating leases were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ending December 31,                             Amount\n2022                                                     53\n2023                                                     65\n2024                                                     63\n2025                                                     60\n2026                                                     58\nThereafter                                              293\nTotal future minimum lease payments                     592\nLess: Lease not commenced                               -19\nLess: Imputed interest                                 -165\nLess: Tenant improvement receivable                      -9\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments    $     399\nFuture minimum sublease income as of December 31, 2021 is $ 7million.\n9. Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an\ninitial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $\n2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest\nrate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.\nIn February 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2020 Notes in full for $\n375million.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a\n108\nTable of Contents\npotential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring recognition of a loss accrual, or whether\nthe potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential disclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”) . The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased\nlegal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business\nmodel and operations. Further, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set\nforth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the\ncompany is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California for payroll tax\nliabilities. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors,\nand thus plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on\nthe merits is uncertain.\nIn October 2019, the Company made an offer, and in November 2019 it filed a settlement agreement, of $ 40million\nwith the representatives of Dashers that had filed actions in the States of California and Massachusetts in order\nto settle claims under the Private Attorney General Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification\nof Dashers against the Company. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August\n2016. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be\npaid by the Company from $ 40million to $ 41million. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amended\nsettlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company from $ 41million to $ 89million. In\nApril 2021, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement increasing the total amount to be paid by the\nCompany to $ 100million. In January 2022, the settlement received final approval and the company anticipates the\npayout of $ 100million in 2022.\nIn March 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain\nDashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under the\nagreement, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers were eligible for settlement payments, subject to a\nthreshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. In July 2020, the\nCompany transferred $ 69million into an escrow account to be paid to claimants and claimants’ attorneys if a\nminimum number of claimants agreed to release their claims against the Company by the date specified within the\nsettlement agreement. In December 2020, the number of claimants who agreed to release their claims against the\nCompany exceeded the minimum, and the Company was committed to release the settlement amount in the escrow account\nto claimants and claimants' attorneys. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the $ 69million in the escrow account\nwas fully distributed to the claimants and claimants' attorneys.\nIn July and August 2020, the Company reached additional agreements to resolve worker misclassification claims\nassociated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the\nCompany. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers were eligible for settlement\npayments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements.\nThe aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual settlement\nagreements, including attorneys’ fees, was $ 14million, which was fully paid in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees\nin violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This\naction is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing\nto classify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred;\nhowever, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\n109\nTable of Contents\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data\nprocessing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not\nrecorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 as the Company has not\nyet received the related services. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-\ncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2022                                   151\n2023                                   152\n2024                                     5\n2025                                     3\nTotal future minimum payments    $     311\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of\nthe federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is\nalso obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit\nfees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative\ncovenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as\ncustomary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions,\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and\nacquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide\nfor $ 100million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon consummation of an IPO of the Company’s\ncommon stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $ 400million. The amendment and\nrestatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024 to August 7,\n2025.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2020 and 2021, noamounts were drawn from the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had $ 66million and $ 60million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 44million and $ 39million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax\nmatters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the\namounts ultimately paid, if\n110\nTable of Contents\nany, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will receive additional assessments by various\ntax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could result in changes to the Company's reserves\nrelated to positions on sales and indirect tax filings. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company favorably\nresolved a sales and indirect tax exposure resulting in a $ 29million reduction of liabilities previously reserved.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement\npursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $\n45.9062per share for gross proceeds of $ 382million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G\nprior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631shares of Class A common\nstock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nconversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company’s respective series preceding the\nCompany’s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nShares                                Per Share        Aggregate\nShares    Issued and          Issuance             Conversion       Liquidati…       Carrying\nSeries        Authorized    Outstandi…             Price                  Price       Preference          Value\nSeries A-1        13,330        13,330    $         0.15          $        0.15    $           2    $         7\nSeries A          27,159        27,159              0.73                   0.73               20             20\nSeries B           7,925         7,925              5.68                   5.48               45             45\nSeries C          26,839        26,839              4.79                   4.79              128            128\nSeries D          98,008        98,008              5.51    -1             5.51              540            535\nSeries E          18,055        18,055             13.85                  13.85              250            250\nSeries F          18,186        18,186             22.48                  22.48              409            476\nSeries G          21,165        21,165             37.94                  37.94              803            803\nSeries H           9,351         8,316             45.91                  45.91              382            382\nTotal            240,018       238,983                                             $       2,579    $     2,646\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $ 5.50688, except for shares issued\nvia the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the\nconversion price was $ 4.78778per share.\nForward Contract In Connection with Issuance of Series F Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn February 2019, the Company issued a total of 13,736,615shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock\nat $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 309million. To accommodate the timing of regulatory approvals\nrequired by an existing investor (who did not participate in the initial issuance of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock), the Company committed to sell 4,449,370shares of Series F redeemable convertible\npreferred stock at $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 100million to this investor in a subsequent closing,\nwhich ultimately occurred in May 2019. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material. At the date of the\ninitial closing, the Company determined that the commitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock to this investor represented a freestanding instrument that should be classified as a\nliability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized in other expense,\nnet in the consolidated statements of operations. The initial measurement of the liability at its fair value of $\n1million was recorded with a corresponding reduction recognized in additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend\ndistributed to the investor. Immediately prior to the subsequent closing in May 2019, the fair value of the\nliability was determined to be $ 68million, resulting in an expense of $ 67million recorded to other (expense)\nincome, net in the consolidated statements of operations which was attributable to the increase in the fair value\nof Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. Upon the subsequent closing, the carrying amount of the\nliability was reclassified to mezzanine equity.\nThe fair value of the liability (valued as a forward contract) at issuance and as of subsequent closing was\ndetermined with the following assumptions:\n111\nTable of Contents\nAs of                 As of\nFebruary 22,               May 14,\n2019                  2019\nCurrent forward price per share             $         22.48          $      37.76\nContractual forward price per share         $         22.48          $      22.48\nRisk-free rate                                         2.46     %            2.41  %\nExpected years until subsequent closing                      0.23               —\nPresent value of contractual forward        $         22.35          $      22.48\nprice per share\nValue of the forward contract per share     $          0.13          $      15.28\nNumber of preferred shares issued in the          4,449,370             4,449,370\nsubsequent closing\nFair value of forward contract              $             1          $         68\nliability(in millions)\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there was nopreferred stock issued and outstanding.\n12. Common Stock\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nStock options issued and outstanding        December 31, 2020    December 31, 2021\nunder the 2014 Plan                                    33,802               19,115\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 and 2020               34,939               27,556\nPlan\nRemaining shares available for future                  32,210               42,196\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                 6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                 107,450               95,366\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (\"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of\nshares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan.\nAll outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the\nterms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation\n112\nTable of Contents\nrights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the Company's\nemployees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are forfeited,\ncanceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available for\nissuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved for\nissuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1,\n2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total number of all\nclasses of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase,\nor (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to the applicable January\n1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020 , the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and\nliquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied\nupon the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nwas achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 279million for IPO Vested RSUs. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining\nservice-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded\nover the remaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award\ndiscussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition\nwhich is generally four years.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\n113\nTable of Contents\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards.

A\ntotal of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each\nfiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any)\noccurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of\nthe outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or\n(iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such\nperiod will begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13.

Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This\nassessment considers matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of\nthe deferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion\nthat it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The\nweight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the\nlack of U.S. earnings history, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation\nallowance. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 154million, $ 97million and $ 1,041million in the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n4,125million and $ 3,265million, respectively. Of the $ 4,125million of federal net operating losses, $\n4,042million is carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income. The remaining federal and\nstate net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and 2024, respectively.\nThe Company also had $ 209million of federal and $ 114million of California research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards as of December 31, 2021. The federal research and development tax credits expire in varying amounts\nstarting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a current\nlimitation on the tax attributes.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $ 7million and $\n69million, respectively, of tax benefits, that, if recognized, majority would result in adjustments to the\nvaluation allowance. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax\npositions existing at December 31, 2021 will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\n117\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020       2021\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        3    $     7    $     7\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                                4          3         62\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                  —         -3          —\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                        7    $     7    $    69\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for income taxes, which were immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax returns generally remain subject to examination by United States\nfederal and state and foreign tax authorities.\n14. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock\nand participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock share equally in the Company’s net losses. Before the IPO, the Company’s outstanding\nsecurities also included convertible preferred stock. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not\nhave a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to\nthese securities.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as\nvested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per\nshare data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019          2020                        2021\nCommon       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nNet loss                     $                     -667    $     -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44\nLess: Deemed dividend to\npreferred                                            -1             —             —             —             —\nstockholders\nNet loss attributable to\ncommon                       $                     -668    $     -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44\nstockholders\nWeighted-average number\nof shares\noutstanding used to\ncompute net loss per                             43,252        60,422         1,968       305,500        31,347\nshare attributable to\ncommon\nstockholders, basic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per share\nattributable to              $                   -15.44    $    -7.39    $    -7.39    $    -1.39    $    -1.39\ncommon stockholders,\nbasic and diluted\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019      2020      2021\nRedeemable convertible preferred stock                    230,953         —         —\n(on an as-converted basis)\nStock options to purchase common stock                     36,247    33,802    19,115\nUnvested restricted stock units(1)                         15,924    17,987    17,139\nConvertible promissory notes                                    —     2,595         —\nTotal                                                     283,124    54,384    36,254\n(1) The CEO Performance Award is excluded from the above table because the Company Stock Price Target had not been\nmet as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n15. 401(k) Plan\n118\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for\neligible employees.\n16. Subsequent Events\nOn February 14, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an ordering and payment platform\ncompany domiciled in the United States for approximately $ 90million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The\ntransaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n119\nTable of Contents"

Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected."

We aim to achieve this by providing logistics, technology, and\nother services that enable local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy.\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace, which operates in four countries including the United\nStates, the Wolt Marketplace, which operates in 23 countries, and Platform Services. We built the DoorDash and Wolt\nMarketplaces (our \"Marketplaces\") to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and the\nindependent contractors who use our platform to generate earnings, or \"Dashers 1 .\" Our Marketplaces enable\nmerchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers.\nMerchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-\nperson pickup by consumers. As part of our Marketplaces, we offer merchants a broad array of services that enable\nthem to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment,\nmerchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our\nplatform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nOur Marketplaces provide a platform for over 32 million monthly active users 2 to discover, engage with, and\npurchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value proposition\nby increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplaces, while also improving\nthe level of convenience, quality, and service we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our membership programs,\nDashPass and Wolt+, which aim to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery\nand service fees we charge consumers. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 15 million 3 DashPass and Wolt+ members.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, which account for the vast majority of our revenue today, we offer several\nservices on our platform (\"Platform Services\"), primarily consisting of DoorDash Drive and Wolt Drive (\"Drive\"),\nwhich are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer demand\nthrough their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes DoorDash\nStorefront (\"Storefront\"), which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience,\nproviding them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-\nhouse engineering or logistics capabilities, and Bbot (\"Bbot\"), which offers merchants digital ordering and payment\nsolutions for their in-store and online channels.\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Platform Services provide opportunities for those looking for accessible and\nflexible ways to earn and achieve their goals. Dashers choose when and where to dash, as well as how frequently and\nfor how long to dash each time they choose to do so.\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents:\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with\na growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives\nincreased adoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, flexibility, choice, and earning\nopportunity that competes effectively for their time.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the\n1 Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt\ncourier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2022.\n3 Excluding Wolt+ members, DashPass members were also over 15 million as of December 31, 2022.\n6\nTable of Contents\nscale of our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services\nthat enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and\nproducts available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability. We believe\nthat we are positioned favorably based on the combination of merchant selection, experience, and value we provide.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, and earnings potential. We believe that\nwe are well-positioned based on the limited requirements necessary to qualify, the density of our network, the\nimproving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nGlobally, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway\n(including Grubhub, which it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online\nordering platforms, online ordering systems, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets,\ngrocers and grocery delivery services, convenience and convenience store delivery services, and companies that\nprovide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. We also compete with traditional offline ordering\nchannels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as\nadvertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. With Drive, and as we continue to\nexpand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies with\nsubstantial resources, users, and market and brand power. As we continue to expand our presence internationally, we\nwill also face competition from local incumbents in these markets.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution\nhave allowed us to quickly extend our network and geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand\nwithin our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about\nthe risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “ Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nBusiness and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. ”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had over 16,800 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None\nof our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that\nour employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2022, well over 6 million people dashed 4 , earning a total of over $13 billion.\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors,\nwe must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities as well\nas alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure. Because of this competition, we must make dashing\nattractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing\npositive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers-to-entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law,\nprospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or\n4 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2022.\n7\nTable of Contents\ncar. People who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up.\nWe know of no other earning opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs,\nschool, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\nEarnings : Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with\nalternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of\nearnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by\nDashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur mission to grow and empower local economies creates a culture that promotes progress in all of our stakeholder\nrelationships. Just as importantly, our business cannot thrive, or even survive, without Dashers. As a result, our\nbusiness and financial ambitions are well aligned with our goal to make dashing an attractive and incremental\nearning opportunity that promotes social progress by giving people more choice in how they achieve their financial\ngoals.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ngeographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and\nretain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we\namplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the\ntools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company.\nThe year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership\nteam, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have eight ERGs: Black@DoorDash, Unidos@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+),\nAAPI@DoorDash (Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), Veterans@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, and\nParents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nMitigating Bias Mandatory Training\nDuring our talent review cycles, we provide custom-designed training to all people managers, focused on educating\nleaders on unconscious bias, upskilling leaders on mitigation tactics, and creating accountability through a scaled\nBias Busters Program to ensure every room has a voice dedicating to mitigating bias. A self-guided online training\nis mandatory for people managers of all levels, and a live, instructor-led training course with practical\napplication exercises is mandatory for more senior leaders.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2022, we had 206 issued U.S. patents, 6 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions, 57 U.S. patent applications\npending, and 19 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts\nto assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2022, we held 44 registered trademarks in the United States and\n122 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered\ndomain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n11\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including with\nrespect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline prices;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of operations may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and\nwe may not be able to achieve profitability, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net\nloss of $468 million and $1,365 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we\nhad an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion and $3.8 billion. We expect our costs will increase over time and our\nlosses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating\nas a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on\ndeveloping our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features\nand services, acquiring and integrating technologies and businesses, expanding into new markets and categories, and\nincreasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in\nsufficient increased revenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue\nsufficiently to keep pace with our\n12\nTable of Contents\ninvestments and other expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow\non a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.8\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nAdditionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations\nthat arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our past revenue growth rate, growth in demand for\nour offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future performance.\nDuring the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. In 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $2.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively,\nrepresenting a 69% year-over-year growth rate. In 2021 and 2022, our revenue was $4.9 billion and $6.6 billion,\nrespectively, representing a 35% year-over-year growth rate. The circumstances that accelerated the growth of our\nbusiness during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to recur, and we expect growth in consumer demand\nand our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to continue to decline in future periods compared\nto growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous\nquarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business\nmetrics growth in future periods.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the short term and\ndecline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market adoption. We may also\nexperience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in\nthe number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in\nthe growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, and increasing regulatory\ncosts. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may\nnot result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our revenue growth rate\ndeclines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway (including Grubhub,\nwhich it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and\nmerchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet\ncompanies with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power. In addition, we compete with traditional\noffline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to\nconsumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. Further, as we\ncontinue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these\nmarkets.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and suppliers, larger existing user bases, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, established geographic footprints and infrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical,\nand other resources than we have. For example, with grocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains\nthat have strong bargaining power, established relationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater\nfinancial resources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and\nefficiently to new or emerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may\nrender our platform less attractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a\nspecific geographic market, or if merchants\n13\nTable of Contents\nchoose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options\nor lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our\ncompetitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves\nor with others, including merchants. For example, in July 2022, Grubhub announced a partnership with Amazon that\nallows Amazon Prime members in the United States to receive a free trial of Grubhub's membership program. Our\ncompetitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake\nmore aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose category share or require us to\nincrease our marketing expenses in order to maintain our category share.\nIn particular, our acquisition of Wolt and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in\ncompetitive pressure from both existing competitors and new entrants in an already highly competitive industry.\nThrough the acquisition, we have expanded our operations in Europe and Asia — regions that are already subject to\nintense competition in many of the categories in which we operate. As a result, existing competitors and any\nsubsequent entrants in Europe and Asia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior\nofferings, or consolidate with other entities and achieve benefits of scale in response to our acquisition of Wolt.\nSuch competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may erode our category share, adversely impact\nour business, and increase the expenses associated with, or otherwise hinder, our expansion in both existing and\nnew markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services, consumer discounts and\npromotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of which may be more attractive\nthan those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission rates and fees\nor maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain competitive, particularly in markets\nwhere we are not in a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively\naffect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the\nmarkets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we\nanticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the\nother competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees,\nor increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local\non-demand delivery services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot\nguarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve, maintain or increase\nprofitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to develop their own platforms to\noffer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the\nlowest-cost provider and could use more than one local commerce platform, independent contractors who provide\ndelivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and merchants\ncould prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more than one\nplatform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as existing\nofferings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain of our\nplatform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than ours, which\nwould make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate. Increased competition could result in,\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform\nusers, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has\ngrown in the past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and\nour national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to\nincur substantial expenses to acquire\n14\nTable of Contents\nadditional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants\nand consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources\nwith the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We\ncannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of\nacquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any\nexclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection\navailable on our local commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our\nrelationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other\nconstituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how\ncompelling these offerings are to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership\nproducts. Additionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain\npromotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and\nofferings to such consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our\nmembership products, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other\nofferings. However, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our\nplatform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our\nconsumers to regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform,\ndemand for our full-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than\nexpected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our websites and consumer mobile applications directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the ability\nto decline orders or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity provisions\nwith Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform and compelling\nopportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase their use\nof our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or work stoppages that could adversely affect\nour users and our business. Relatedly, If merchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack\nsufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our\nability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other things, invested in\nmaking the use of our Dasher applications, and dashing, as frictionless as possible, created new ways for Dashers\nto earn and get paid, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, including credits to be used for orders on our\nplatform, tips and assistance using the Dasher applications, and access to programs that provide cashback rewards\non certain purchases, including gasoline. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing\nDashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase\nuse of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse consequences, including negative\npress, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation. Changes in\ncertain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the\npool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and\nengagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or\ninsurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers.\nIf we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our\nplatform by\n15\nTable of Contents\nexisting Dashers, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods at affordable prices, meeting\nour requirements and standards, experience problems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, or choose to\nraise the prices of their goods on our platform for any other reason, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nFurther, an increase in merchant operating costs, or other deterioration in financial condition, whether due to\ninflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or\ncease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. If merchants\non our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform. Additionally,\nsome items on our platform are listed at higher prices relative to their in-store prices. This practice can\nnegatively affect consumer perception of our platform and could result in a decline in consumers or order volume,\nor both, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between our Marketplaces and Platform Services;\nthe contribution to our overall business of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal\npatterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe contribution to our overall business of our advertising products and services, including the effect that\nmarket conditions may have on our ability to sell these products and services;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response of governments\nand private industry;\nthe impact of price controls that may be imposed by various jurisdictions, and any associated increase in the\nfees we may have to impose to offset such price controls;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become\nincreasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of\nour platform, especially during peak usage times, as our operations grow and the usage of our platform increases.\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result\nfrom interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nevents have resulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of\nrevenue and may harm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to\nconsumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event,\nincluding for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the\navailability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and\ncould result in the loss of users.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. For example, on May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Wolt.\nWe have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to evaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent\nmarkets and there is no assurance that such acquired businesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we\nenter into, will be successfully integrated into our business, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits\non a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies, operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts, and\npersonnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating accounting, finance, and forecasting practices of acquired businesses with our own,\nespecially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with foreign jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public\ncompany like ours at companies we may acquire that prior to acquisition may not have robust controls, procedures,\nand policies, in particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security\npractices, incident response plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, compliance with privacy,\ndata protection, information security, and other regulations, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and\nsanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, information security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition\nor other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\n18\nTable of Contents\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operation, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or if\nthe transaction costs are greater than expected.\nIn particular, the ongoing integration of Wolt into our business poses heightened risks, including write-offs or\nrestructuring charges, unanticipated costs, regulatory and compliance risk associated with operating in a number of\nnew jurisdictions, operational difficulties, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the\nintegration will be accomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the integration of Wolt will\nsubject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the acquisition,\nsome of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt\nand we have certain rights of indemnification, including an escrow of acquisition consideration to secure certain\nobligations of Wolt's securityholders, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or\nthat the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow consists of shares and therefore, even if we are\nable to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and resources to pay for the liabilities and damages.\nThese liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition not currently known to us\nor that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, including our profitability.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in\nOctober 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private grocery delivery platform\ncompany based in Europe. Strategic investments inherently involve less control over business operations of the\ninvestee, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks\nassociated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners,\ncontrolling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business\ninterests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions\nor omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them\nmay adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may\notherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our investments\nmay be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities\nnow or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct\ninvestment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory\nreview, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our\nability to carry out our long-term business strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments\nwill generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For\nexample, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, in the course of evaluating our investments, we determined\nimpairment indicators existed for a previously disclosed investment in a grocery delivery platform company.\nFollowing a valuation of this investment, we incurred an impairment of $312 million associated with our non-\nmarketable equity securities.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets\nand arrangements and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\nmarkets as part of our growth strategy. We launched our platform in Canada in 2015, Australia in 2019, Japan and\nGermany in 2021, and New Zealand in 2022. We continued our expansion in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of\nWolt in 2022, which brings the number of countries that we operate in outside the United States to 26. Our\noperations outside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to\noversee operations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition\nto placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our current\ninternational operations and\n19\nTable of Contents\nour plans for investment in non-U.S. markets subject us to a number of risks and we may not be successful in our\ninternational operations for a variety of reasons, including:\nan inability to recruit and retain talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintain our company\nculture across all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, Dashers, and consumers in non-U.S.\nmarkets;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to labor and\nemployment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment processing,\ntransactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the civil\nunrest in Kazakhstan required Wolt to temporally suspend its business operations in the country due to safety and\nsecurity concerns, as well as the unavailability of, and significant disruptions to, Internet service. While we\nhave been able to resume business operations in Kazakhstan, such events may occur in the future in other countries\nor regions leading to similar disruptions. In addition, Wolt's operations in markets that are in close proximity to\nRussia increases the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to business with\nRussia.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local commerce platforms will have an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, fees and commissions charged by local\ncommerce platforms have been under increased scrutiny and are expected to continue to be subject to political and\npublic debate in the jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate. Many jurisdictions in which we have\noperations have price control measures in effect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may\nbe enacted in the future. These price controls have caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we\ncharge to consumers. To the extent that price control measures lead to an increase in the fees we charge to\nconsumers, consumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of\noperations. Our risks related to price controls are described in more detail under “— Our business is subject to a\nvariety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and\nmerchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such\nlaws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations and subject us to legal claims .”\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we\npay to Dashers that utilize our platform, further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase\nour marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive\npressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher\nor consumer loyalty programs, such as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing\nmethodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower\ncommissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and\npricing methodologies may not be competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion\nmay require us to change our operations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including\nwith respect to consumer pricing and gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the services\non our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers in the United States, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led,\nand may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For\nexample, under a former pay model for Dashers in the United States, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on\na delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers\nby making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be\nunder the misimpression that not all tips were being received by Dashers. Government authorities have brought\nclaims against us related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model and may bring similar claims in the future. For\nexample, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to our\nformer DoorDash Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and judgment to\nresolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model from other\ngovernment authorities in the future.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity. For example, we increased the amount we pay to DoorDash Dashers per order when we changed our\npay model in September 2019, but this pay model also causes less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some\ncases. Further,\n21\nTable of Contents\nthis pay model has resulted in, and in the future may result in, negative publicity related to perceptions of its\ncomplexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips,\nand as a result, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the\nfuture, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes and expansion into new categories and\ngeographies, we may change our Dasher pay models again. Our current Dasher pay models, and any future changes to\nour pay models or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the\nfees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or laws of other jurisdictions in which we\noperate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been involved in and continue\nto be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June\n2020. Certain risks related to reclassification of Dashers that use our platform are described in more detail under\n“ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law , or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate , our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected .” A reclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and Dasher pay models to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other\nsubstantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions,\nwhich would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. We have\nexperienced rapid employee headcount growth at our San Francisco headquarters, in a number of our offices across\nthe United States, internationally, and with employees working remotely globally. We have also expanded our\npresence, both in employee headcount and operationally, in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of Wolt. This\ngrowth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of our rapid\ngrowth, including at Wolt and other companies we may acquire, could result in errors in our consolidated financial\nstatements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our\nreporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price\nof our Class A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in\norder to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations. Similarly, our failure to\nimplement and maintain effective data and information security systems with respect to our platform as we grow\ncould result in breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service disruptions, loss of user confidence in our\nplatform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation or brand, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in\n22\nTable of Contents\nour industry further intensifies. Similarly, maintaining and enhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be\nparticularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and\nenhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the\nsuccess of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our\nability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos,\nand other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our\ncontrol. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform,\nwhich in turn drives new user growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-\neffective. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local commerce platforms\nand services, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our user base, we must appeal\nto new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect\nof negative publicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are\ndisseminated via social media, due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of communication. Any such\nexpressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to be unfounded or successfully resolved\nwithout direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand, reputation, and local network effects.\nNegative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nincluding highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including\nDasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee couriers or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\n23\nTable of Contents\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases, viruses or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases, viruses, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related mitigation\nefforts have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, or any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business will depend on factors that are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the availability of effective vaccines, regulatory actions impacting\nmerchant operations, consumer and merchant pricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings, and changes to consumer\nbehavior or spending patterns.\nWe may also be adversely affected as a result of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future outbreak\nof disease could have on our third-party providers and merchants. Merchants may experience temporary closures of\ntheir businesses, supply chain delays, labor shortages, and the unavailability of certain products, which could\ncause merchants to limit their operating hours or cease operations entirely, impact the selection available on our\nplatform, and disrupt our ability to operate. To the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public\nhealth threat has an impact on our business, it is likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, Dasher\npay models, user support, technology, platform policies, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues,\nprivacy or security practices, management team, compliance with laws and regulations, or the health and safety of\nDashers, employee couriers, merchants, and consumers using our platform could adversely affect our reputation. Such\nnegative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and loyalty of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which\nDashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general\nfood safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform,\nwhich has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of\nour brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our\nreputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands, influencers, or other third parties\nthat we have partnered with or may partner with in the future may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is\nnot directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use\nof, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ndata relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees.\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external actors or\nwith our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an external\nparty or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current geopolitical\nenvironment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors, which could target\nbusinesses. These incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems, which can be leveraged to access our websites,\nplatforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of\nbreaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors\nthat resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers and Dashers. In addition, in December\n2021, we investigated and patched Log4j vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could have allowed for unauthorized\nremote code execution in our systems. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and governance program,\nwhich include adding security layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional personnel with data\nsecurity experience, and using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all\npotential causes of these incidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or other\nincidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or\nprevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors\nmay face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means, including gaining unauthorized access to the systems of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that use our platform. In addition, there may be attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants,\nconsumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other\nsensitive information resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the prevalence of remote\nwork, we may be exposed to increased risks of breaches or incidents via such methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures have not\nfully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and infrastructure may\nbe vulnerable to viruses, social engineering, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing, ransomware\nand other malware, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption, and unauthorized parties may be\nable to access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data, through those systems.\nAlthough we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, these policies may not be effective\nin all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or similar incident could interrupt our operations, harm our\nreputation, brand, and competitive position, result in our platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to,\nor unavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant\nlegal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such incidents or any perception that our security measures are\ninadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, any\ncyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could\nreduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident, impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot\nguarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects,\nbugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors’\nsystems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage\nfor these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be\nadequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be available\nto us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future\nclaim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or changes in\nour insurance policies, including premium increases\n25\nTable of Contents\nor the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation,\nbrand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe on-demand local commerce category is still in relatively early stages of growth, and if this category does not\ncontinue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is still\nrelatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. The markets\nfor certain services we facilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories,\nmay be in even earlier stages of development than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for\nthese services will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance, if at all. In addition, through our\nacquisition of Wolt, we have entered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce\ncategory may be at different stages of market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the\nwillingness of people to widely adopt on-demand local commerce platforms. Changing traditional ordering habits is\ndifficult, and if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local commerce platforms as we\nexpect, including as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a\nresult of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopt alternative\nsolutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop slower than we\nexpect, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may negatively impact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are\nconsistent with our goals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results\nover the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and\nmay not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers, have\noccurred, and in the future may occur, which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. These activities include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation,\nhandling, or delivery, including the use of unsafe or inappropriate delivery equipment, assault, battery, theft,\nunauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering Dasher\naccounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities\nmay result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments\nby consumers with insufficient funds, exploitation of system bugs or vulnerabilities to circumvent payment\nrequirements, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers of Dasher accounts by bad\nactors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal\ninformation, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or payment information and\nunauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone\nnumbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying\ninformation to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, in the United\nStates, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as\nDashers. We have launched a series of initiatives and product changes to help prevent these practices, but there\ncan be no assurances that our efforts will be successful in fully remediating this or similar issues.\n26\nTable of Contents\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, these measures may\nnot adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability,\nincluding through litigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we\nhave deactivated from our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform\ndeliveries. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check where permitted by\napplicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from\nusing our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are\nperceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors do not adopt similar measures, the growth and engagement\nof the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which enables merchants on our\nMarketplaces to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are retained directly by\nmerchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in any of the other\nactivities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Any negative publicity\nrelated to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, or the measures we adopt\nto mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a whole, which\ncould negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. For\nexample, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair competition, among other claims, and\nsought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. In addition, measures have been enacted in\nmany U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local commerce platforms like ours from\nfacilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent. We have adopted internal policies\npursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our platform in the United\nStates and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United\nStates to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with us. However, we continue to add non-partner\nmerchants in categories other than restaurants. In the future, we may continue to revise and update our internal\npolicies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to\nremove non-partner merchants for any reason, this may adversely affect our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants on our platform, attract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand\n27\nTable of Contents\nimprove our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely affected. To\ncompete effectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable consumer experience on our\nplatform, and we may be unable to effectively address consumer needs or identify emerging consumer trends. If\ncompetitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and practices or\nconsumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may become less\npopular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone\ndelivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our partners’\ntechnology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend on our ability\nto invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a\ncost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our personnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not\ngenerate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging\nindustry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if\nour recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks with our convenience, grocery, and other retail operations in connection with our self-\noperated convenience and grocery stores.\nWe face certain risks in connection with the operation of DashMart and Wolt Market, our first-party owned and self-\noperated convenience and grocery delivery businesses. To build and expand DashMart and Wolt Market, we have made\nsubstantial investments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for groceries, including\nthe maintenance of a cold chain to ensure food safety and hygiene, establishing supply-related contractual\npartnerships, inventory management, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies and\nprocesses. We also plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of\nour DashMart and Wolt Market businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will\nrealize any of the anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able\nto generate a sufficient number of orders to make such services viable in certain locations and we may incur\nsignificant costs before we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-\noperated retail locations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and\nPlatform Services, in particular with respect to food safety, alcoholic beverage licenses, and zoning restrictions.\nOur expansion into convenience, grocery, and other retail categories, may also result in the diversion of\nmanagement’s attention from other business opportunities as well as the diversion of resources from support\nfunctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the resulting gains in\nefficiency to our platform that\n28\nTable of Contents\nwe expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number of risks,\nincluding changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost effectiveness of our\nplatform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do not reduce the\nnumber of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are unable to\nmaintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher\npay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of non-U.S. based\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English and in ways consistent with the customs and dominant\ntechnologies used in the various geographies in which we operate. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect\nour ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of\nthe calendar year, although our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to\nmake, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder\nor more inclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand.\nIn contrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather, during times\nwhen we need more Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we\ntypically rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which\nincreases our costs. Further, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it\nimpossible for Dashers to fulfill deliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets\nwhen school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during\nsummer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a decrease in Dasher pay and adverse effects to our results of\noperations during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a\nquarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience\nmay become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to\nscale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations and we may not be\nable to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations\nto fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to variable global economic conditions in the regions in which we do business and their\nimpact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors that may impact consumer spending on our platform\ninclude general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, fluctuations in household net worth, inflation\ngenerally, fluctuations in gasoline, vehicle, and transportation costs, increased food costs, fluctuations in\ncommodity prices, declines in asset prices, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices,\nchanges in interest rates and credit availability, consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the current and\nfuture political and economic environment, and other macroeconomic factors. Economic conditions in certain regions\nmay also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats\nto public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsumer purchases, particularly of discretionary items, may decline during recessions and other periods in which\ndisposable income is adversely affected, periods of economic uncertainty, or when there is a loss of consumer\nconfidence in the economy. Consumers may choose to reduce their spending on our platform or forego spending on our\nplatform\n29\nTable of Contents\naltogether. Further, because spending on our platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that\nany decline in consumer spending would have a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses\nthat sell products or services considered to be necessities. If spending on our platform declines, or grows at a\nslower rate, including as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our Drive\nbusiness. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand\nand drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Drive business. Small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small business merchants,\ncease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not\nbe able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, including in connection with our acquisition of Wolt, we have increasingly become\nsubject to risks arising from adverse global economic and political conditions, including Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine. While our business does not operate in Russia or Ukraine, we have operations in countries that border\nRussia and Ukraine and are exposed to the economic impacts of that conflict on the region. Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in the region and give\nrise to volatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and\nDashers on our platform. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could also negatively impact consumer confidence and spending\nglobally and in the neighboring countries in which we operate, disrupt supply chains, and drive inflationary cost\nincreases for labor, fuel, materials, food, and services, all of which may negatively impact our business.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new geographic markets and categories in which we have\nlimited or no prior operating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new geographic markets and categories. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately\npredict consumer preferences and purchasing habits in these new geographic markets and categories. In addition,\neach market and category has unique regulatory dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or\nindirectly affect our ability to operate, the pool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with\ninsurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new Dashers. In addition, each market and category is subject to distinct\ncompetitive and operational dynamics. These include our ability to offer more attractive services than alternative\noptions and our ability to efficiently attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect\nour sales, results of operations, and key business metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our\nresults of operations due to the changing dynamics in the geographic markets and categories in which we operate. If\nwe invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. For more information on\nrisks associated with entry into new markets internationally see the section titled “— Our international operations\nand any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be\nsuccessful. ” For more information on risks associated with the entry into new categories see the section titled “—\nWe face certain risks in expanding our convenience, grocery, and other retail operations, especially in connection\nwith our self-operated convenience and grocery stores .”\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in foreign countries. When\nconducting business in foreign countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country. Our most significant foreign\ncurrency exposure is currently to the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, the Australian dollar, and the\nJapanese yen. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, local currencies will be converted\ninto U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, thereby\nincreasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public\nmarkets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of\ncash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit,\ntrain, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions, including in the case of our acquisition of\nWolt;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nAny of the foregoing factors may be further exacerbated as a result of the reduction in workforce that was\ndisclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 1, 2022. If we are not able to maintain and evolve our\nculture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal,\naccounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and\nplace significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, and any failure\nto do so could impact our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\nexcessive number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return\nto our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not\neffectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and\n32\nTable of Contents\nanticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and\navailability of our platform, as well as other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by\nmalicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach\nor other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze,\ncorrect, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to\ntimely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax\nwithholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued\nwith respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have\nthe holders of such RSUs use a broker to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement\ndate, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in\norder to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations, which is generally referred to as \"sell-to-\ncover,\" or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker, sufficient to cover\nthe applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. If we withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would\notherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in\ncash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We have implemented\n“sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market value equivalent to\nthe tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover\nthe tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the taxing authorities.\nSuch sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding\nobligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax\nwithholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number of\nshares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted\nGross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required\nby regulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as\nrequired by Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently\nverified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due\nto differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have\na number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result\nin unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools\nwe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors,\nthe data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our\nplatform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by\nfraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even\nthough this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior.\nConsumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition,\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data\n33\nTable of Contents\nor with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which\ncould affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business,\nif investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in our operating metrics and business and we expect that we\ncould be subject to legal claims, including securities class action lawsuits, and our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions\nand insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive\nmodeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our\nestimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the\ndetermination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined\nand negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our operations as a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior\n34\nTable of Contents\nmanagement and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in\njurisdictions in Europe and Asia, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as\nindependent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an independent contractor or an employee vary by\ngoverning law and are typically highly fact intensive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and\nconsumers that use our platform. For example, in October 2022, the U.S Department of Labor released a proposed rule\nregarding the classification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\nThe proposed rule would implement new interpretative guidance for classification of workers. We maintain that\nDashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors. However, Dashers may be\nreclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on worker classification and\ntheir potential impact on the local commerce industry. A reclassification of Dashers as employees would adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability to add and retain Dashers to our platform\nand grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. For more details on this\naction, please see the section titled \" Legal Proceedings \" above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, and Asia have modified, or are considering modifying, their\nstandards used to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill\n(\"AB 5\") and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January\n1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and\ncreated numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22\n(“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in\nNovember 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court\nin California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney\nGeneral and other groups and individuals\n35\nTable of Contents\nappealed to the California Court of Appeal. To the extent Proposition 22 remains in effect, certain provisions\nregarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California.\nThese provisions have increased our costs related to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of these increased\ncosts, in certain circumstances we charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes\nover time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs\ncould also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, which we referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as\nrevenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now\napplicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other\namounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged\ntime and (B) for Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for\ninflation in future years) and (ii) for Dashers averaging at least 15 hours per week of engaged time during a\ncalendar quarter who subscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of\nvarying dollar amounts depending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 has had, and may\ncontinue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support\nlegislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, that would pair worker flexibility and\nindependence with new protections and benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we\npropose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, we would expect our costs\nrelated to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such\njurisdictions if it becomes necessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would\nadversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such\ninitiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs\nfiled a claim in California Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in\nthe Alameda County Superior Court’s order finding the entirety of Proposition 22 unenforceable. If Dashers are\ndetermined to be employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate,\nincluding as a result of litigation, this could result in increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would\nlikely lead us to increase fees and commissions and may result in lower order volumes, which in turn would have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration (through\nthe Division at the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland) issued a decision which deemed that\nWolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that Wolt should be mandated to\nkeep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. We have appealed the decision to the Administrative\nCourt of Hämeenlinna. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the standards used to determine\nworker classification, which may impact our classification of Dashers using our platform. For example, the EU is\nconsidering new criteria for determining worker classification, which could be adopted by member states. Any\npotential EU-wide legislative reform may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent contractor\nmodel within the EU.\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, we may\ndecide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result in certain operational\nchallenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain jurisdictions or decide not to expand our\nbusiness in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal, regulatory, and other administrative\nproceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, labor and\nemployment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints, intellectual property\ndisputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations,\nand legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by merchants and\n36\nTable of Contents\nDashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes\nchoose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the uncertainty of\nlitigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face increasing\npublic scrutiny. Similarly, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages or\nalcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any\nconsumers, Dashers, employees, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand,\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our\nplatform that generate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our\nbusiness. The potential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if\nsuch an event occurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through\nour platform could be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a\nfood recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our\nplatform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher,\nincluding our background check processes, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email,\ntext, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers\nrelating to, among other things, our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect\nto sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery fulfillment services we\nfacilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our websites and consumer mobile applications and the menus at the\nrestaurant from which the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and\ntaxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or\ntelephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsites and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such\nproceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. There can be no\nguarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings could also\nresult in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders requiring a\nchange in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal\nobligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and current\nand former directors and officers.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of\n37\nTable of Contents\narbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either\nof which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our\nplatform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our\nbusiness or to local commerce platforms generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes and digital\nservices taxes. Such taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada, Australia, and several\ncountries in Europe and Asia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise\nquestions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest,\nincluding tax on the cost of goods sold, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by\none or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to\ncollect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate\nauthorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants\ntry to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we\nhave reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, if\nthese liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nUnder U.S. state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and to the cost of goods, fees, or other\nitems charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, or other\ntaxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and\nadditional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our platform. Any\nof the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. , certain states have enacted\nlaws that require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on certain online sales. Requiring tax reporting or\ncollection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. These laws could\nrequire us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including\n38\nTable of Contents\ncosts associated with tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our\nofferings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nFurther, we have several subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with local transfer pricing rules and regulations,\nand failure to comply with such rules could adversely affect our financial condition. Transfer pricing rules\ngenerally require pricing on intra-group transactions to meet an arm's-length standard, which is inherently\nsubjective and subject to challenge. Additionally, these rules generally require documentation substantiating the\nappropriateness of such pricing, which may vary based on the jurisdiction. As a result, we may be exposed to\ntransfer pricing risks, as governmental authorities may challenge our compliance with these rules.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of\noperations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax\noutcome is determined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the realization of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any\nchanges in the United States or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate\nand harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as\nin the jurisdiction we or the applicable subsidiary is incorporated or organized, as well as the jurisdiction from\nwhich such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable U.S.\nor non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our\noperations.\nFederal, state, local, and foreign governments may amend existing taxation laws or enact new taxation legislation\napplicable to our business activities, including but not limited to legislation adopting the Pillar One and Pillar\nTwo agreements of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). These changes in legislation\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. In addition, the application of\nfederal, state, local, and foreign taxation laws to our business is novel and evolving, and new judicial or\nadministrative interpretations of these laws may increase our tax exposure. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority or judicial body would not\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to\nemployment taxes and sales taxes are described in more detail under “ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are\nreclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected ” and “ —Taxing\nauthorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ”\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion of U.S. federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to\nexpire in 2036 for U.S. federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate\nsufficient taxable income in time to use these NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and\nSection 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of\n39\nTable of Contents\n1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use\nits pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be\nlimited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply\nunder state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards, to\nreduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership\nchanges and ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will\ndetermine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code. In addition, we have accumulated $692\nmillion of foreign net operating losses, which may be available to reduce future taxable income in the relevant\njurisdiction. Some of these foreign NOLs will begin to expire in 2025 and it is possible that we may never realize\nthe benefits of these losses.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of\nNOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen\nreasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and\nother tax attributes.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, and merchant pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and\nstandards governing issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for\nexample, those concerning Dasher pay and insurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food\nsafety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, online credit card payments, gratuities, merchant\npricing and commissions, text messaging, membership products, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data\nsharing, data security, consumer protection, background checks, website and mobile application accessibility, and\ntax and other government-imposed fees are often complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations,\nin many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are\napplicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations\nbetween U.S. law and the laws of other countries, U.S. state and federal law, between individual states, and even\nat the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time\nthrough judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been proactively working with national, federal,\nstate, and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly in the United\nStates and foreign jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing laws would be applied to our business and\nthe new laws to which it may become subject.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business.\nFurther, we are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and\nlocal laws regulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, such as\nproducts containing Cannabidiol (CBD). These regulations and laws dictate matters such as licensing requirements,\nadvertising restrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our\noperations resulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or\nchanges to the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or\nregulations could result in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of alcoholic beverages or\nother highly regulated products in a jurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased production, sales or\nmarketing costs, or changes to our business practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand,\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, particularly\nfollowing our acquisition of Wolt, we have become subject to a growing array laws and regulations, which increase\nthe complexity and compliance risk inherent in our business. For example, the EU recently enacted various\nregulations that govern digital services and markets and impose environmental sustainability obligations and\ndisclosure requirements on businesses like\n40\nTable of Contents\nours. In particular, in November 2022, the Digital Services Act entered into force in the EU and includes new\nobligations to limit the spread of illegal content and illegal products online, increase the protection of minors,\nand provide users with more choice and transparency. The impact of these new regulations on the overall industry,\nbusiness models, and our operations is uncertain. We may be required to enhance our disclosures and undertake\ncertain changes to our products, services, fees and commissions structure, and operations as a result of these new\nrequirements. Furthermore, we could be subject to administrative costs, regulatory proceedings, and fines, any of\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, competition authorities in some of the markets in which Wolt operates have made queries regarding, or\ninvestigated, Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices and decisions have been issued by competition\nauthorities and courts concerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms and practices. Any violation of competition laws\ncould result in restraints in the way in which we operate our business. We could also be subject to claims of\nviolations of competition laws in other aspects of our business, such as alleged market sharing, price fixing, or\nexchange of competitively sensitive information. Any potential violations of competition laws could result in\nfines, render applicable pricing-related provisions or contracts unenforceable, require contractual amendments, and\nlead to claims for damages and reputational harm, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with laws and regulations across the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate and to\npredict and adapt to changes in these laws is critical to our success, particularly for our continued expansion\nefforts, which may include entries into new geographic markets or new verticals in existing or new geographic\nmarkets. Additional regulatory scrutiny or changes in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs\nand make it uneconomical for us to continue to operate in all of our current markets or to continue with our\nexpansion plans, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different\noperating countries. This may adversely affect our business and financial condition by preventing us from reaching\nsufficient scale in particular markets or having to change our business model or incur additional costs. Our\ninability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to additional\nregulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement actions, such as fines, penalties, or\nenforceable undertakings.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws, requiring businesses like ours to maintain specific\nauto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses like ours agree to with merchants\nor the fees that we may charge consumers. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in\neffect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These price\ncontrols have had in the past, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These\nprice controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers. To\nthe extent that price control measures lead to an increase in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer demand for\nour services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of operations. In addition,\ncertain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or collect such increased consumer fees on our\nplatform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as confusing and/or misleading to consumers.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses or other organizations\nthat perceive our business model negatively to raise their concerns to policymakers and regulators. These\nbusinesses and their trade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant\nresources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market\npresence in an effort to change such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede\nour business and the ability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply\nwith these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that we may not be able to anticipate at\nthis time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to\nthis liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain services or platform\nfeatures, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations\ncould also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and\ncivil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased\nattention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect\nour reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this\npotential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any\nviolation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could\nresult in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees,\nloss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government\ncontracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse\nconsequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define money transmitter\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider for its payment\nservices to merchants in European Economic Area (\"EEA\") countries and has obtained a payment institution license\nfrom the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II. Should our payment institution license\nbe revoked in the future, or any other enforcement measures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory\nAuthority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease offering certain payment facilities, our operations in\nEurope would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand into new jurisdictions, the payment-related\nregulations that we are subject to will expand as well. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with\napplicable rules and regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings,\nforfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant\nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt\nour ability to operate in certain jurisdiction and otherwise adversely effect our business and results of\noperations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media\nmarketing, advertising\n42\nTable of Contents\npractices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband\nresidential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws\ngoverning issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the\nInternet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is possible that foreign\ngovernment entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or websites or may even attempt\nto block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with\nany of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business, and\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as\nother personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal,\nnational, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use,\ndisclosure, and protection of certain types of data and require the notification of certain security breaches\ninvolving personal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change\nthrough new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be\ninconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any changes in these laws or regulations could add further\ncomplexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of resources in\ncompliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in business practices\nand policies. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in our efforts to comply with\ncurrent and evolving privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by law,\nregulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nApplicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property and the personal data of our\nusers. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December 2021 that would require us to\nprovide consumer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and delivery addresses to restaurant\nmerchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a consumer opts out. This could result in consumers\nreceiving unsolicited communications from merchants, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have\nfiled a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the\npendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect\non our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe are increasingly subject to additional laws relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity as we expand\nour international operations. For example, with our acquisition of Wolt, we expanded our liability under the EU’s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which imposes strict requirements relating to the processing of\npersonal data as well as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against the processing of personal data,\nand civil litigation claims for noncompliance.\nWe rely on legal mechanisms for transferring personal data subject to GDPR. In 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield\nFramework was invalidated in the Schrems II case by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has created\nsignificant challenges in using other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data from the EEA to other\ncountries. The uncertainty around data transfers and global trends relating to national data localization could\npresent risks with respect to non-compliance, as well as increased costs to comply with complex and evolving\nrequirements.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be contractually\nrequired to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the\ncosts or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy,\ndata protection, information security, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect, and use data relating to Dashers,\nmerchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is further\nrestricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, and other practices, the amount or accuracy of Internet\nuser information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations that\nsignificantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the use of\nonline tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem.\nMoreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as Apple and Google, plan to or have\nimplemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block\n43\nTable of Contents\ntracking technologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely\nadopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. As a result, we may have to\ndevelop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently\nmarket to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or\ncybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal\ndata or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the perception of privacy\nconcerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation and\nbrand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our platform, or result in fines,\ninvestigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to legal claims resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to certain risks, including liabilities or\nclaims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automated\nSMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil claims against\nus. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are\ncontinuously evolving and developing. If we are not able to comply with these laws and regulations, including the\nTCPA, in an effective manner, we could be subject to legal claims and liability, our brand and reputation may be\nharmed, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") is subject to interpretation by\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a\nsignificant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed\nbefore the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\nNo. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers (Topic 606)” (“ASC 606”), which superseded nearly all existing\nrevenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC\n842”), which increases lease transparency and comparability among organizations. It is difficult to predict the\nimpact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect\nour reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business\ninterruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident\nliability for Dashers, and general business liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or risks\nrelated to our new and evolving services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. Even if\nwe do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, we may\nnot obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured\nretentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it\nwould be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers\nterminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable\nterms, we would be required to find alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a\nsuitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we\nprocure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in\nviolation of the terms of these merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and\ndeductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could\nincrease substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are\nrenewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if\n(i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and\ncoverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to\npay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of\nclaims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”),\na third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We do not have control\nover the operations of the AWS facilities that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption\nfrom natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of\nmisconduct. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will continue to experience, interruptions,\ndelays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including\ninfrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In\naddition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on\nour platform. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand. Since our\nplatform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system\nfailures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform, usage of our platform, lead to loss of revenue, increase\nour costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur primary commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate\nthe agreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the\nagreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a\n30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice.\nAlthough it would be difficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more\nalternative cloud infrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event\nthat our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may\nexperience significant costs or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of,\nnew cloud infrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of,\nnew cloud infrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations over the longer term.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily PayPal and\nStripe. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, anti-money laundering,\nand similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors, we may be subject\nto claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher\ntransaction fees and\n45\nTable of Contents\nmay lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our platform\nless convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe and other payment service\nprovider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in such data.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card\nnetwork operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks\ncould adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from\nproviding certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with\nthese rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept\ncredit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our\nthird-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks\nif we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal\nand/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are\nnot qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be\nadversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the\nrequirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to\nfind an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\ntime frame. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check\nprovider. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not\nbe able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential\nDashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background\nchecks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our\nexpectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be\nunable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers\nmay be inadvertently excluded from our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and\nbrand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In\naddition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we\nmay not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our\nplatform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related to notice\nrequirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in\ncertain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct\nsuch background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping\n46\nTable of Contents\nfunction that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all mapping\nfunctions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions\nmay not be reliable. Any failure by us to understand and manage our exposure to the risks associated with the use\nof third party software, such as the risk of misuse of confidential or proprietary information or the exposure to\ncybersecurity incidents, could adversely impact us. For example, integration issues could prevent the onboarding of\nnew third party software providers or lead to the loss of existing providers. Furthermore, updates to third party\nsoftware that integrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously\nhad or at all. Any changes in these systems that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential\ntreatment to competitive services may impose could adversely affect usage of our platform. From time to time we\nhave had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of our third-party software providers. If, in\nconnection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its relationship with us or otherwise limits the\nprovision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our platform could be disrupted. If the third\nparties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Dashers use, whether in\nconnection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be\nattractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required\nto seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at\nall, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with PayPal, Stripe, Twilio, Olo, Google Maps, AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-\nparty applications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify\nour platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition,\nsome of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our\nplatform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms\non which we, operate and distribute our platform. As our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of\ncompetition we face to increase. Should any of our competitors or merchants on our platform modify their\ntechnologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform\nor is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our\nplatform, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements\nfor consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency\n47\nTable of Contents\nframework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned\nto adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that\nthese changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions. If we are\nunable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as\nwell as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to\nhow and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors,\nmany of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change\nits ranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-\nparty sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources\nor the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, we may lose the confidence of our investors and\nour reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly\nleading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims\nbrought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and\nabroad may be necessary in the future to\n48\nTable of Contents\nenforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of\nothers. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise\nsecure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be\nineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source\nsoftware license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and\ntime and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected\nportions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and\nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software\nuntil we can adequately address the concerns.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures,\nstrategic initiatives, or investments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future\nissuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could\nsuffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsuperior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time,\nand our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,\nand operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be\nable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our\nbusiness growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2022,\nthere were no revolving loans outstanding and $99 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued\nunder our revolving credit facility.\n50\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2022, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,\nand a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of\nour board of directors collectively held 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate,\nwhich voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards\n(including those equity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering (\"IPO\") and subject\nto equity exchange right agreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require\nus to exchange any shares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class\nA common stock or the vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent\nnumber of shares of Class B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO\nPerformance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31,\n2022, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 73% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-\nFounders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable\nproxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their\nrespective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by\nstockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the\napproval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or\nour Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to\nherein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr.\nXu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person\ndesignated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person, then our secretary then\nin office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days\nfollowing the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180\ndays following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or\nconsultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary\nresignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to\nbe renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually\n51\nTable of Contents\nresult in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer\nhave the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for\na vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would have no voting rights (except as\nrequired by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the\nvoting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay\nthe final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued\nto Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our voting power and\nhis ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our\nstockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and, in that event,\nthey would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without\ndiminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to\napproval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2022, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of\nthe voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a\n“controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange\nregarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\nadvisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Under such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible\nfor inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are\nrelatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the long-term valuations of publicly-traded\ncompanies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar\ncompanies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into\n52\nTable of Contents\npassive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude\ninvestment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a\nresult, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nWe have authorized share repurchase programs in the past and may authorize other share repurchase programs in the\nfuture. Under existing or any future share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of\nmethods, including open share market purchases, block transactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in\naccordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not\nobligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and\nwithout prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price,\nmarket and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements, such as Delaware surplus and\nsolvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have\nannounced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may\nnegatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n54\nTable of Contents\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment."

Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. In January 2022, the Superior Court of\nCalifornia, County of Los Angeles, granted final approval of a revised settlement agreement pursuant to which we\nagreed to pay $100 million to the representatives of Dashers that had filed certain actions in California and\nMassachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of\nDashers (the \"Marko settlement\"). All legal matters under the Marko settlement have been resolved and all amounts\nrelated to the Marko settlement were paid by us during the second quarter of 2022. See the section titled “Legal\nProceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for additional information regarding the proceedings related to the\nMarko settlement.\nVarious other Dashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their\nclassification on our platform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law,\nseeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by\nindividual Dashers, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to\nour independent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco\nDistrict Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California\nLabor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers\nas independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range\nof losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September\n2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was\napproved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners\nconsisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County\nSuperior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as\nunconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California Court of\nAppeal.\nIn addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may\npropose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, which would pair worker\nflexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with\nDashers, policy makers, and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To\nthe extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or\nother legislative processes, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we\ncould experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of\nsuch laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and\nsimilar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation.\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker\nclassification.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. Further, in certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of\napplicable law, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result\nin certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain countries or decide not\nto expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.\n57\nTable of Contents\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with\nconsumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation\ninsurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of\nthe State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued a negative\nassessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA EDD’s assessment,\nand intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. For more information on the CA EDD's assessment, see Note 10 –\n\"Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental action are\ninherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a\nmaterial impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an\ninvestigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action.\nRegardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with\ncooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors."

We provide a local\ncommerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive\nin today’s convenience economy.\nWe operate a local commerce platform that connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our primary offerings are the\nDoorDash Marketplace, which operates in four countries including the United States, and the Wolt Marketplace, which\noperates in 23 countries, most of which are in Europe. Both of our Marketplaces provide a suite of services that\nenable merchants to establish an online presence, generate demand, seamlessly transact with consumers, and fulfill\norders primarily through Dashers. As part of our Marketplaces, we also offer Pickup, which allows consumers to\nplace advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash\nfor Work, which\n60\nTable of Contents\nprovides merchants on our platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The\nDoorDash Marketplace also includes DashPass and the Wolt Marketplace includes Wolt+. DashPass and Wolt+ are our\nmembership products, which provide members with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and\nreduced service fees on eligible orders.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive and Wolt\nDrive, which are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer\ndemand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes\nStorefront, which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a\nturnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or\nfulfillment capabilities, and Bbot, which offers merchants solutions for their in-store and online channels,\nincluding in-store digital ordering and payments.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at\nthe public offering price of $102 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares in\nthe IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

For more information regarding our use\nof these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed through our Marketplaces and Platform Services\nbusinesses over the period of measurement.\nIn 2022, Total Orders increased to 1.7 billion, or 25% growth compared to 2021. The increase in Total Orders was\ndriven primarily by growth in consumers and increased consumer engagement as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\n61\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces,\nincluding taxes, tips 5 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and\nWolt+. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not\ninclude the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through\nDrive and Storefront.\nIn 2022, Marketplace GOV increased to $53.4 billion, or 27% growth compared to 2021, driven primarily by organic\ngrowth in Total Orders as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\nContribution Profit (Loss). We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\n(iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off\nrelated to restructuring. Gross profit (loss) is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn 2022, Contribution Profit improved to $1.6 billion, compared to a Contribution Profit of $1.1 billion in 2021,\ndriven primarily by growth in Marketplace GOV, an increase in Net Revenue Margin, defined as revenue expressed as a\npercentage of Marketplace GOV, and leverage on sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in\ncost of revenue.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certa in limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss)\nis not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is\nnot a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total\ncompany profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests,\nadjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on\ndisposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition,\nintegration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory\nwrite-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income) and\nexpense, (ix) other (income) expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense,\nand (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage\nin our business.\nIn 2022 , Adjusted EBITDA increased to $361 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $289 million in 2021 , as\ngrowth in Contribution Profit was partially offset by organic increases in adjusted research and development\nexpenses and adjusted general and administrative expenses, as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nIn 2022 , Free Cash Flow decreased to $21 million, compared to Free Cash Flow of $455 million in 2021, driven\nprimarily by changes in operating assets and liabilities and increases in cash outflows from purchases of property\nand equipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\n5 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n62\nTable of Contents\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplaces to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplaces to\narrange for delivery services. We recognize reve nue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for\nboth partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects comm issions charged to partner merchants and\nfees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain\ndiscounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our\nMarketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part\nof our Marketplaces revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable\nbasis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership\npurchased by the consumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services, which primarily consists\nof our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants\nto arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is\nrecognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, costs related\nto placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we take\ncontrol of inventory (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for\nproviding support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii)\npersonnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support,\nand other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus,\nbenefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined based on an allocation of shared\ncosts, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information technology costs, among all departments\nbased on employee headcount.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses\nassociated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, transaction-related expenses, bad debt\nexpense, and allocated overhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nour property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation primarily includes expenses associated with\nequipment for merchants, computer equipment and software, office equipment, and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and website development costs, as well as\nacquired intangible assets.\n63\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges primarily consist of separation-related payments and other termination benefit costs\nassociated with a reduction in workforce that is discussed in further detail in Note 17 – \"Restructuring\" included\nin Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as\ncosts associated with other restructuring activities in 2022.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs primarily related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind\ninterest on our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including\nimpairment, as well as gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes primarily results from losses generated outside the U.S. for which an\nincome tax benefit was recognized, as well as the income tax expense associated with U.S. state and foreign\noperations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)

LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, and further amended on October 31, 2022, provides for a\n$300\n71\nTable of Contents\nmillion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on August 7, 2025, which increased to $400 million in\naggregate revolving commitments upon the consummation of our IPO, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of\ncredit in an aggregate face amount of up to $200 million. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our\noption, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the federal funds rate or\na composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-month interest period\nplus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of one, three, or six months) plus a margin\nequal to 1.00%. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type,\nincluding letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2022, we were in\ncompliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nno revolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December\n31, 2021 and 2022, we had $60 million and $132 million of issued letters of credit outstanding, respectively, of\nwhich $39 million and $99 million were issued under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nConvertible Notes\nOn February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the\nConvertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto. We\nreceived net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an original issue discount of\n$5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. In\nFebruary 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible Notes in full for $375\nmillion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of\nour Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $3.9 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.5 billion and long-term marketable securities of $397 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $441 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and commercial paper. Marketable\nsecurities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $3.8\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nWe have an obligation to our insurance provider which requires us to set aside collateral of up to $265 million in\nan escrow account. As of December 31, 2022, we had established and deposited into an escrow account an amount of\n$199 million, which is restricted from general use. We deposited the remaining collateral amount of $66 million on\nFebruary 1, 2023.\nIn February 2023, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $750 million. This program is in addition to the prior\nrepurchase program for the repurchase of $400 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was completed in\nthe third quarter of 2022. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through\nprivately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant\nfactors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of\nthe Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our\nClass A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a\nvariety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment\nopportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be\n72\nTable of Contents\nrequired to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from\noutside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                     2020         2021       2022\nNet cash provided by operating              $                      252    $     692    $   367\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                             -192       -2,047       -300\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing                         3,996         -483       -375\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                2           -1        -10\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash       $                    4,058    $  -1,839    $  -318\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $367 million for 2022 . This primarily consisted of a net loss of $1.4\nbillion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes $889 million of non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense, $369 million of depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash reduction of operating\nlease right-of-use assets, $303 million of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment,\nnet, and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $81 million, as well as $73 million net inflows from changes\nin operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses. The decrease in cash\nprovided by operating activities for 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to the increase in net loss for 2022 .\nCash provided by operating activities was $692 million for 2021 . This consisted of a net loss of $468 million,\noffset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $486 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense\nof $156 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease\nliabilities of $52 million, and non-cash bad debt expense of $36 million, as well as $391 million net inflows from\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $300 million for 2022 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $1.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $176 million, cash outflows for capitalized\nsoftware and website development costs of $170 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $15\nmillion, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.9 billion and net cash\nacquired in acquisitions of $71 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion for 2021 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $2.3 billion, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $409 million, purchases of property\nand equipment of $129 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $108\nmillion, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $944 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $375 million for 2022 , which consisted repurchases of our Class A common\nstock of $400 million, partially offset by cash received from other financing activities of $14 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $11 million.\nCash used by financing activities was $483 million for 2021 , which consisted of $333 million of repayment of the\nconvertible promissory notes, $172 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of\nequity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, partially offset by $32 million of proceeds\nfrom the exercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and\n73\nTable of Contents\nliabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various\nother assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is\nrecognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a\nratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of\nmembership purchased by the consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting\nper-order fees from merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill\ndemand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local\ncommerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\n74\nTable of Contents\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through our Marketplaces. Those gift cards have no expiration\ndate and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to\nconsumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract\nliabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is\nrecognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to\nmerchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed sufficient\nhistorical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the\nportion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal\nobligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned\nproperty. We recognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the\ngift card redemptions. We recorded $48 million and $47 million of gift card breakage revenue during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and\nhistorical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals : We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results\nmay differ from estimates. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited\noperational history, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry\nclaim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected\nloss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information\nbecomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our\nreserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible.\n75\nTable of Contents\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions\non a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. However,\nwe believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $409 million and $124 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Adjustments or impairments are recorded in other income (expense), net on\nthe consolidated statements of operations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome (loss) from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international\nbusinesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Based on\nour foreign currency exposures from\n76\nTable of Contents\nmonetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022, we estimated that a 10% change in exchange rates against\nthe U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\n77\nTable of Contents"

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nThe Company acquired Bbot, LLC (“Bbot”) and Wolt Enterprises Oy (“Wolt”) during 2022, and management excluded from\nits assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, Bbot’s and Wolt’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets (excluding acquired\ngoodwill and intangible assets) of 5% and total revenues of 4% included in the consolidated financial statements of\nthe Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nof the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bbot and Wolt.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n79\nTable of Contents\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition-date fair value of acquired intangible assets\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 31, 2022, the Company acquired Wolt\nEnterprises Oy (Wolt) in a business combination for $2,838 million, which was accounted for under the acquisition\nmethod of accounting that requires allocation of the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The\nCompany recognized an acquired merchant relationships intangible asset associated with the generation of future\nincome from Wolt’s existing merchants using a replacement cost method. Additionally, the Company recognized a\ntrademark intangible asset associated with the value of Wolt’s brand name and an existing technology intangible\nasset associated with Wolt’s existing online and mobile platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and pickup\norders using a relief-from-royalty method. The acquisition-date fair values of the merchant relationships,\ntrademark, and existing technology intangible assets were $236 million, $268 million and $150 million,\nrespectively.\nWe identified the evaluation of the acquisition-date fair value measurements of the aforementioned intangible\nassets as a critical audit matter. Due to limited observable market information, a high degree of subjective\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used to estimate the fair values, including the\ndiscount rate used in the valuation of each of the aforementioned intangible assets, and the revenue growth rates\nused in the valuation of the trademark and existing technology intangible assets. The estimated acquisition-date\nfair values of the aforementioned intangible assets were sensitive to changes to these assumptions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition-\ndate valuation process, including controls related to the development of the estimated revenue growth rates and\ndiscount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates by comparing them to those of Wolt’s\ncomparable peers and industry reports. We compared the Company’s estimate of forecasted revenue growth in the first\nyear to Wolt’s actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. We involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\nevaluating the appropriateness of the comparable companies selected by the Company’s third-party valuation\nadvisor used to determine the revenue growth rates by assessing the business description of the comparable\ncompanies and the industries in which they operate; and\nevaluating the discount rate used in the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets by (1) assessing the\nreasonableness of the estimated market participant weighted average cost of capital (WACC) through a comparison of\ninputs to available market data, and (2) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount from the\n80\nTable of Contents\nWACC to the discount rate used in the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets by assessing the risk of\nthe individual assets relative to the overall acquired business through a weighted average return on assets\nanalysis.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which\ninclude retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2022 was $418 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 24,

Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany operates a local commerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease\nand immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company operates a local commerce platform that connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company's\nprimary offerings are the DoorDash Marketplace, which operates in fourcountries including the United States, and\nthe Wolt Marketplace, which operates in 23countries, most of which are in Europe. Both the DoorDash Marketplace and\nthe Wolt Marketplace (\"Marketplaces\") provide a suite of services that enable merchants to establish an online\npresence, generate demand, seamlessly transact with consumers, and fulfill orders primarily through independent\ncontractors who use the Company’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”). As part of the Marketplaces, the Company\nalso offers Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders\nconveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company’s\nplatform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The DoorDash Marketplace also\nincludes DashPass and the Wolt Marketplace includes Wolt+. DashPass and Wolt+ are the Company’s membership\nproducts, which provide members with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced\nservice fees on eligible orders. In addition to the Marketplaces, the Company offers Platform Services, which\nprimarily includes DoorDash Drive and Wolt Drive (\"Drive\"), which are white-label delivery fulfillment services\nthat enable merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using\nthe Company’s platform. Platform Services also includes DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\"), which enables merchants\nto create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers\non-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or fulfillment capabilities, and Bbot\n(\"Bbot\"), which offers merchants solutions for their in-store and online channels, including in-store digital\nordering and payments.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold\n33million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $ 102.00per share. The Company\nreceived net proceeds of $ 3.3billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock automatically converted into 239million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior\nto the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\nauthorizes a total of 6.0billion shares of Class A common stock, 200million shares of Class B common stock,\n2.0billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285million shares of the Company’s common stock were automatically\nreclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Reclassification”).\nImmediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31million shares of Class\nA common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for\nan equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a\nresult, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with both service-based and liquidity event-\nrelated performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company’s IPO, the Company\nrecognized $ 279million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs was settled and\ndelivered on June 7, 2021 (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date”). The future tax benefits on settlement of the\nabove RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to reduce\nits net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n88\nTable of Contents\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net\nshare settle, the Company withheld 65,058shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested\nRSUs and paid $ 7million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any\nincome tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to\nreceive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that accrued at the applicable federal rate. The short-\nterm loan extended to employees totaled $ 10million, which was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of shares into\nthe market on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 – \"Revenue\" for revenue by geography. Long-lived assets, which consist\nof property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, located outside of the United States were $\n28million and $ 124million a s of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit\nlosses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website\ndevelopment costs, intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other\nfinancial instruments including valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation of\nacquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance\nreserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their\n89\nTable of Contents\ncarrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash consists of collateral\nprovided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies.As of December\n31, 2021 and 2022, the restricted cash balances were $ 2million and $ 211million, respectively.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits\nthe concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with maturities greater than three\nmonths, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with maturities greater than one year\nare included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable securities are classified as\navailable-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the\nCompany evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the\namortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically\nrelated to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nWhen a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the\ndebt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be\nrecorded. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was\nrecorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with\nmerchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company’s assessment of\nthe collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a\ncollective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay and\ncollection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.Disposals were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n90\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2022 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Noimpairment charge was recorded in any\nof the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment.\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company recognized\nimpairment charges of $ 11million, $ 1million and $ 2million, respectively, related to an operating lease right-of-\nuse asset associated with its former headquarters, which the Company subleased to another company.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given its limited\noperational history, the Company utilizes\n91\nTable of Contents\nassumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development\nfactors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are\nperiodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However,\nultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could result in losses over the Company’s reserved\namounts.During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company recorded additions to the insurance\nreserves of $ 63million, $ 134million and $ 359million, respectively. The Company’s retained insurance deductibles\nreserves as of December 31, 2022 was $ 418million.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s\nforeign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into\nU.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant. Prior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a\nservice-based vesting condition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting\ncondition. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the\nCompany's IPO, and the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 279million as of the IPO\ndate for those RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation\nrelated to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was\nsatisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.\nSince November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award and options assumed via acquisition (as\ndiscussed further in Note 12 - \"Common Stock\"), the Company only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a\nservice-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as defined below) that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award was\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the\nderived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the\nderived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative\nexpense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether\nthe stock price goals are achieved.\n92\nTable of Contents\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying\ncommon stock. The Company’s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company’s common stock by\nconsidering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined\nbased on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net\namount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of\nfuture taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\n93\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in funds held at\npayment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to\nDashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-\nauthorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering.As of December 31, 2021, two entities in dividually accounted for 15% and 14% of accounts\nreceivable, net, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, one entity in dividually accounted for 14% of accounts\nreceivable, net. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and\n2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through its Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of the Marketplaces . Revenue generated from the\nCompany’s DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\ncommerce platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local commerce platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item\nseparately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable\nas the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service\nindividually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation\n94\nTable of Contents\nservices, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether it controls\neach specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through its Marketplaces. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. Th ose gift cards have no\nexpiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited\nhistory as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded\nas contract liabilities until consumers used the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that it\nhad developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have\nthe ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for\nwhich there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as\nunclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the\npattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. The Company recorded $ 48million and $ 47million of\ngift card breakage revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Estimating future\nbreakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage\nrates may vary from the estimate.\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local commerce platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below.\n95\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 698million, $ 1.2billion and $ 1.1billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to DoorDash,\nInc. common stockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating\nsecurities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any\nremaining earnings would be distributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common\nstock pro rata on an as-converted basis. These holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are\nnot contractually obligated to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, the Company’s net losses were not\nallocated to these participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the\nClass A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting\nrights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net\nlosses. Noshares of Class C common stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Prior to the\ncompletion of the IPO, there were noshares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in\n96\nTable of Contents\nwhich the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common\nshare, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not been settled have\nbeen included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company’s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred\nstock were automatically converted into 239million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified\ninto stockholders' (deficit) equity.As of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, there were noshares of redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from fourto five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no\nresidual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if it has a variable\ninterest in an entity and if it is the primary beneficiary. These evaluations are complex and involve judgment and\nthe use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other\nfactors. If the Company determines that entities for which the Company holds a contractual or ownership interest in\nare variable interest entities (\"VIE\") and that the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates\nsuch entities in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets\nboth of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either\ncase could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in the\ninterest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether the Company is still the primary\nbeneficiary. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the\ninvestment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n97\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nCosts and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are\nincurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless\nfuture service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Ongoing employee\ntermination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is\nreasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated\nstatements of operations and related liabilities are recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates\nbased on currently available information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\")\n2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) : Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts\nwith Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and\ncontract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, as if it had\noriginated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are\nrecognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted the guidance in 2022\nand the impact of the adoption was not material.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomprised of the Company's Marketplaces and Platform Services.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer.

The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nand merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over\ntime.

When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 68million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. The ending\nbalance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\n98\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover.

Acquisitions\nWolt Acquisition\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of Wolt\nEnterprises Oy (“Wolt”). The Company's aim is to accelerate its product development, increase its international\nscale, bring greater focus to its markets outside the United States, and improve the value provided to consumers,\nmerchants, as well as Dashers around the world. The Company’s acquisition-related costs for the year ended December\n31, 2022 were $ 48million. All costs were recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of operations during the period in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred for Wolt was $ 2,838million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nDoorDash Class A common stock             $       2,705\nStock-based compensation awards\n(DoorDash options, RSUs, and revesting                   133\ncommon stock) attributable to\npre-combination services\nTotal consideration                       $       2,838\nThe fair value of 36million shares of Class A common stock issued was determined on the basis of the closing market\nprice of the Company’s Class A common stock on the acquisition date. The Company also issued certain stock-based\ncompensation awards and their fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\napplicable assumptions as of the acquisition date for options ( 1.7million DoorDash options) and using the closing\nmarket price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date for RSUs ( 1.4million DoorDash RSUs).\n99\nTable of Contents\nFor certain Wolt employees, a portion of their total consideration transferred was restricted subject to revesting\nover a service period, including 568thousand shares of the Company's Class A common stock. This restricted equity\nconsideration is considered compensation for post-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based\ncompensation expense over the next four years, based on the fair value of the shares using the closing market price\nof the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Wolt acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 1,994million of goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Wolt and anticipated synergies from the\nfuture growth and strategic advantages in the global local commerce industry. The goodwill recorded in connection\nwith the acquisition of Wolt is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, and are considered preliminary and subject to\nchange within the measurement period, including potential adjustments to sales tax balances and other liabilities,\nas additional information is received. During the three months period ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded\nmeasurement period adjustments which had an immaterial impact on the total consideration and the preliminary\nallocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company\nexpects to finalize the allocation of the purchase price as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from\nthe acquisition date when the measurement period ends.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\nacquisition date (in millions):\nMay 31, 2022\nCurrent assets                   $           272\nIntangible assets                            772\nGoodwill                                   1,994\nOther non-current assets                      82\nCurrent liabilities                         -201\nDeferred tax liability, net                  -34\nOther non-current liabilities                -47\nTotal purchase price             $         2,838\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful life as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       May 31, 2022\nMerchant relationships                            11    $           236\nTrademark                                         10                268\nExisting technology                                6                150\nCustomer relationships                             3                107\nCourier relationships                              1                 11\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $           772\nExisting technology represents the existing online and mobile Wolt platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and\npickup orders. The merchant, customer, and courier relationships represent the fair value of the underlying\nrelationships with merchants, such as restaurants and grocery stores, users of Wolt’s food and delivery services,\nand courier partners. The estimated fair values of the existing technology and trademarks were determined using a\nrelief from royalty method. The fair values of the merchant, courier and customer relationships were determined\nusing a replacement cost method. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a\nstraight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\nFrom the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022, the amount of revenue and net loss from Wolt included in\nthe consolidated statements of operations were $ 259million and $ 345million, respectively.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Wolt acquisition had\nbeen completed on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the comparable annual reporting period.

The addition of Bbot's\nproducts and technology to the Company's platform will offer merchants more solutions for their in-store and online\nchannels, including in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition\nmethod of accounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $\n9million indemnification holdback, which was recorded in other liabilities.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Bbot is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value\nof assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, and are\nconsidered preliminary pending finalization of the valuation analyses pertaining to assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, which primarily relate to acquired intangible assets.

The fair value of the Company’s Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from\nindependent pricing services, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments in less\nactive markets or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity securities\nof $ 409million and $ 18million, respectively, for equity securities of private companies including an investment\nof $ 395million in preferred shares of a grocery delivery platform company during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAll those investments were accounted for using the measurement alternative, where the Company adjusts the value of\nthe\n103\nTable of Contents\ninvestments based on changes in value due to observable price changes for identical or similar securities of the\ninvestee or impairment.\nThe Company evaluates investments in non-marketable equity securities for impairment based on a qualitative\nassessment considering various impairment indicators. The Company determined impairment indicators existed as of\nDecember 31, 2022 for the investment in the grocery delivery platform company. A valuation was performed to\ncalculate an equity value of the investee, using a market approach, which was then allocated to the preferred\nshares owned by the Company based on contractual rights and preferences using the option pricing model (“OPM”).

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2023 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. Lease\ncosts, net of sublease income, was $ 46million, $ 66million, and $ 86million during the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nOperating lease cost     $                       40    $    52    $    81\nShort-term lease cost                            11         17          9\nSublease income                                  -5         -3         -4\nTotal lease cost         $                       46    $    66    $    86\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2021            2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            9.77            8.08\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  6.81%           6.39%\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021       2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       46    $    75\nleases\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                      164    $   154\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 19million and $ 21million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced. Such leases are not included\nin the operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n106\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022, the future minimum lease payments required under operating leases were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ending December 31,                             Amount\n2023                                                     96\n2024                                                     98\n2025                                                     91\n2026                                                     84\n2026                                                     63\nThereafter                                              274\nTotal future minimum lease payments                     706\nLess: Lease not commenced                               -21\nLess: Imputed interest                                 -157\nLess: Tenant improvement receivable                     -17\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments    $     511\nFuture minimum sublease income as of December 31, 2022 is $ 8million.\n9. Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an\ninitial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $\n2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest\nrate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.\nIn February 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2020 Notes in full for $\n375million.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”). The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased\nlegal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business\nmodel and operations. Further, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set\nforth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the\nCompany is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California (the “CA EDD”) for\npayroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain amounts that it found to be\nowed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent contractors. The Company\nbelieves that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors. Accordingly, the Company\nbelieves that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse assessment. Results of\naudits and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an\naudit having a material impact on the Company's\n107\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations and the determination of a final assessment amount, and\nany related penalties, cannot currently be predicted with certainty but a loss at this time is not probable or\nestimable.\nIn January 2022, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted final approval of a revised\nsettlement agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $ 100million to the representatives of Dashers\nthat had filed certain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under the Private Attorney\nGeneral Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of Dashers against the Company (the \"Marko\nsettlement\"). All legal matters under the Marko settlement have been resolved and all amounts related to the Marko\nsettlement were paid by the Company during the second quarter of 2022. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings”\nin the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for additional information regarding the proceedings related to the Marko\nsettlement.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data\nprocessing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not\nrecorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 as the Company has not\nyet received the related services. As of December 31, 2022, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-\ncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2023                                   172\n2024                                   101\n2025                                     9\nTotal future minimum payments    $     282\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provided for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. In August 2020, the Company amended\nand restated the revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide for $ 100million of incremental revolving loan\ncommitments, effective upon consummation of the Company's IPO, for total revolving commitments of $ 400million. The\namendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024\nto August 7, 2025. Loans under the credit facility, as further amended on October 31, 2022, bear interest, at the\nCompany’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the federal\nfunds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-month\ninterest period plus 1.00%, or\n108\nTable of Contents\n(ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of one, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%.\nThe Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including\nletter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains\ncustomary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of\nproceeds, as well as customary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among\nother things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other\ndistributions, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments,\nloans and acquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2021 and 2022, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had $ 60million and $ 132million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 39million and $ 99million were issued under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax\nmatters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the\namounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from the\namounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will receive additional\nassessments by various tax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could result in changes to\nthe Company's reserves related to positions on sales and indirect tax filings.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement\npursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $\n45.9062per share for gross proceeds of $ 382million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G\nprior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631shares of Class A common\nstock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nconversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company’s respective series preceding the\nCompany’s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nShares                                Per Share        Aggregate\nShares    Issued and          Issuance             Conversion       Liquidati…       Carrying\nSeries        Authorized    Outstandi…             Price                  Price       Preference          Value\nSeries A-1        13,330        13,330    $         0.15          $        0.15    $           2    $         7\nSeries A          27,159        27,159    $         0.73          $        0.73               20             20\nSeries B           7,925         7,925    $         5.68          $        5.48               45             45\nSeries C          26,839        26,839    $         4.79          $        4.79              128            128\nSeries D          98,008        98,008    $         5.51    -1    $        5.51              540            535\nSeries E          18,055        18,055    $        13.85          $       13.85              250            250\nSeries F          18,186        18,186    $        22.48          $       22.48              409            476\nSeries G          21,165        21,165    $        37.94          $       37.94              803            803\nSeries H           9,351         8,316    $        45.91          $       45.91              382            382\nTotal            240,018       238,983                                             $       2,579    $     2,646\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $ 5.50688, except for shares issued\nvia the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the\nconversion price was $ 4.78778per share.\n109\nTable of Contents\n12. Common Stock\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn May 2022, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $ 400million of the Company’s Class A common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 5.6million shares of its Class A common stock at a\nweighted average price of $ 71.84per share for a total amount of $ 400million. The shares were retired immediately\nupon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company has granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the Wolt acquisition.\nVesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment at the Company during the\nrequisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance date. The fair value of the\nrestricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is recorded as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of                    Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares                 Grant Date\n31, 2021                                            —       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                           568    $                 76.91\nVested                                            -93    $                 76.91\nForfeited                                          -3    $                 76.91\nUnvested restricted stock as of December          472\n31, 2022\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nStock options issued and outstanding       December 31, 2021    December 31, 2022\nunder the 2014 Plan and Inducement Plan               19,115               16,021\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 Plan,                 27,556               45,131\n2020 Plan and Inducement Plan\nRemaining shares available for future                 42,196               39,995\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                 95,366              107,646\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based\n110\nTable of Contents\nawards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of shares of common stock available\nfor issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014\nPlan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to\nthe terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO registration statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the\nCompany's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are\nforfeited, canceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on\nJanuary 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total\nnumber of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each\nautomatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to\nthe applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\n2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “Inducement\nPlan”), pursuant to which the Company reserved 9,760,000shares of Class A common stock to be used exclusively for\ngrants of equity-based awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, as a\nmaterial inducement to the individual’s entry into employment with the Company. The Inducement Plan permits the\ngrant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and\nperformance shares. Shares that actually have been issued under the Inducement Plan under any award will not be\nreturned to the Inducement Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Inducement Plan;\nhowever, if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares or performance units are\nrepurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such shares will become\navailable for future grant under the Inducement Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to\nsatisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under\nthe Inducement Plan. The exercise price, term, and any other terms and conditions of the options granted under the\nInducement Plan will be determined by the administrator of the plan.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020 , the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and\nliquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied\nupon the effectiveness of the IPO registration statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nwas achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 279million for IPO Vested RSUs. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining\nservice-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded\nover the remaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award\ndiscussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition\nwhich is generally four years.\n111\nTable of Contents\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $ 12million, $ 112million and $ 112million of stock-based compensation expense related to the\nCEO Performance Award during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31,\n2022, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 177million.\n112\nTable of Contents\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 Plan, 2020 Plan and Inducement Plan was as follows (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2021                     19,115    $       2.60                 4.59    $      2,797\nAssumed via acquisition                              1,710    $       4.11\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                           -4,780    $       2.30                                  451\nCancelled and forfeited                                -24    $       4.09\nBalance as of December 31, 2022                     16,021    $       2.84                 3.48    $        737\nExercisable as of December 31, 2022                 15,676    $       2.80                 3.47    $        721\nVested and expected to vest as of                   16,021    $       2.84                 3.48    $        737\nDecember 31, 2022\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the NYSE as of the respective\nperiod-end dates.

Key assumptions of the Black-Scholes valuation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected\nvolatility, expected term and expected dividends. The Company determined the expected term of assumed in the money\noption awards considering vesting provisions, the expected exercise behavior, and contractual term of the awards.\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration\nto the expected term of the stock option awards. The Company developed the expected volatility using the average\nvolatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of similar publicly traded peer companies.\nThe Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on its common\nstock.\nThere were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, except for the options\nassumed via acquisition. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options assumed via acquisition\nfor the periods presented were as follows:\n113\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020                       2021      2022\nExpected volatility         —                          —       69.13%\nRisk-free rate              —                          —        2.29%\nDividend yield              —                          —            —\nExpected term (in years)    —                          —         1.69\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nCost of revenue, exclusive of             $                       31    $    46    $   102\ndepreciation and amortization\nSales and marketing                                               37         52         98\nResearch and development                                         171        182        365\nGeneral and administrative                                        83        206        313\nRestructuring charges                                              —          —         11\nTotal stock-based compensation expense    $                      322    $   486    $   889\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 12million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested\nstock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.77years.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 2.6billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nunvested restricted stock and RSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the\nCEO Performance Award.

A\ntotal of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each\nfiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any)\noccurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of\nthe outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or\n(iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such\nperiod will begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13.

It is not practicable to estimate the amount of\ndeferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nDeferred tax assets                                 2021         2022\nAccruals and reserves                    $           104    $     132\nStock-based compensation                              36           74\nTax credits carryforward                             237          209\nOperating lease liabilities                          101          115\nCapitalized research and development                   —          619\nNet operating loss carryforward                    1,050          660\nOther                                                  —           88\nTotal gross deferred tax assets                    1,528        1,897\nLess: Valuation allowance                         -1,398       -1,655\nTotal deferred tax assets net of                     130          242\nvaluation allowance\nDeferred tax liabilities\nProperty and equipment and intangible                -36         -134\nassets\nROU assets                                           -83          -94\nDeferred contract costs                              -15          -17\nTotal gross deferred tax liabilities                -134         -245\nNet deferred tax liabilities             $            -4    $      -3\nDuring 2022, the Company effectuated certain tax-planning actions which reduced the amount of net operating losses\ngenerated in 2021 by $ 2.4billion with a corresponding increase to other deferred tax assets which will reverse in\nfuture periods. These tax-planning actions did not result in additional income tax liability for 2021.\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires a reduction of the carrying\namounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This\nassessment considers matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of\nthe deferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion\nthat it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The\nweight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the\nlack of earnings history, the Company's deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance, with\nthe exception of certain foreign jurisdictions. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 97million, $\n1.0billion and $ 257million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.1billion and $ 1.6billion, respectively. Of the $ 2.1billion of federal net operating losses, $ 2.0billion is\ncarried forward indefinitely. Of the $ 1.6billion of state net operating losses, $ 342million is carried forward\nindefinitely. The remaining federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and\n2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n692million that begin to expire in 2025.\nThe Company also had $ 181million and $ 102million of federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The federal research and development tax credits expire in\nvarying amounts starting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward\nindefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a current\nlimitation on the tax attributes.\n116\nTable of Contents\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        7    $     7    $    69\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                                3         62         19\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                 -3          —        -19\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                        7    $    69    $    69\nThe Company had $ 69million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, the majority of which would\nnot affect its effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's valuation allowance. The majority of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits relate to income tax positions which, if recognized, would be in the form of additional\ndeferred tax assets that would be offset by a valuation allowance. The Company does not anticipate that the amount\nof unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at December 31, 2022 will significantly increase or\ndecrease within the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for income taxes, which were immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the\nattribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to\nthe extent utilized in a future period. The material jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to potential\nexamination include the United States and Finland. The Company’s 2016 and subsequent tax years remain open to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in\nFinland.\n14. Net Loss per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock\nand participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock share equally in the Company’s net losses.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as\nvested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand per share data):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2020                        2021                        2022\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nNet loss\nincluding\nredeemable          $                -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44    $   -1,260    $     -108\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nLess: Net loss\nattributable to\nredeemable                              —             —             —             —            -3             —\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nNet loss\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.      $                -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44    $   -1,257    $     -108\ncommon\nstockholders\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute net\nloss per\nshare                              60,422         1,968       305,500        31,347       342,015        29,398\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders,\nbasic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per\nshare\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.      $               -7.39    $    -7.39    $    -1.39    $    -1.39    $    -3.68    $    -3.68\ncommon\nstockholders,\nbasic and\ndiluted\n117\nTable of Contents\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is\ncontingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the respective\nperiods (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020      2021      2022\nStock options to purchase common stock                  33,802    19,115    16,021\nUnvested restricted stock and restricted                28,366    27,518    45,172\nstock units\nConvertible promissory notes                             2,595         —         —\nEscrow shares                                                —         —     2,012\nTotal                                                   64,763    46,633    63,205\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company did not make contributions for\neligible employees for any of the periods presented.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEmployees based in Finland are covered under the Finnish Employees’ Pension Act (“TyEL”). TyEL is a statutory\nprivate sector pension act that is partly funded and paid through a pay-as-you-go pool. The Old-age Pension and\nDisability Pension benefits of TyEL are classified as postretirement benefits under defined benefit plan accounting\nstandards and based on an actuarial valuation. The Old-age Pension liability for active employees includes the\neffect of future salary increases. The Disability Pension liability for active employees is based on employees'\ntotal salary two years before the fiscal year.\nNet periodic benefit cost is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Service cost is\nreflected in total costs and expenses. Other components of net periodic benefit cost, including interest cost and\namortization of actuarial gains and losses, is included in other (expense) income, net. Actuarial gains and losses\nresulting from remeasurement are initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n16. Variable Interest Entities\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company formed a joint venture with a retail partner in Canada with the objective of providing\non-demand delivery of grocery and convenience items to customers in Canada (the \"JV\"). The Company owns a majority\ninterest in the JV.\nIn connection with the formation of the JV, the Company has committed to contribute cash and certain assets worth $\n98million Canadian dollars (approximately $ 74million US dollars) over three years. Upon the closing of the\ntransaction, the Company contributed cash and certain assets of $ 41million Canadian dollars (approximately $\n32million US dollars). Additional capital contributions will be made in a manner that preserves the ownership\npercentage of each shareholder.\nThe common units held by the Company in the JV were determined to be a variable interest. The Company is the\nprimary beneficiary because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\nperformance of the JV. As a result, the Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the JV.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total assets and liabilities of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheets\nwere $ 68million and $ 17million respectively.\nThe JV’s assets may only be used to settle the JV’s obligations and may not be used for other consolidated\nentities. The JV’s liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of the Company’s other consolidated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the minority shareholder’s ownership in the JV is classified as redeemable non-controlling\ninterest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the Company’s control. The redeemable non-\ncontrolling\n118\nTable of Contents\ninterest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest\nwill become redeemable. Total redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 14million as of December 31, 2022. Net loss\nattributable to redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 3million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n17. Restructuring\nOn November 30, 2022, the Company committed to a reduction in workforce (the “Plan”) intended to better align the\nCompany’s talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Plan included the\nelimination of approximately 1,250positions across the Company, or approximately 7% of the Company’s current\nemployee workforce at such time. The Company expects that it will incur $ 82million in restructuring charges in\nconnection with the Plan, consisting of separation-related payments and other termination benefit costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 82million in restructuring charges, consisting of\n$ 68million related to cash expenditures for separation-related payments, benefits, and related taxes, $ 17million\nin stock-based compensation related to equity compensation, which was partially offset by a $ 6million benefit\nrelated to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expenses for unvested stock awards, and $\n3million non-cash expense related to the acceleration of prepaid compensation for employees who were terminated.\nThese expenses are included in restructuring charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and\nunpaid amounts are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company expects that most cash payments and expenses related to the Plan will be completed by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the total amount incurred and accrued related to these restructuring activities (in\nmillions):\nWorkforce reduction costs\nAccrued restructuring as of January 1, 2022                                 —\nRestructuring charges incurred during the                                  82\nyear\nCash payments                                                             -17\nNon-cash settlements and other adjustments                                -14\nAccrued restructuring as of December 31, 2022    $                         51\nIn addition to the Plan described above, there were other restructuring charges of $ 10million arising from other\nrestructuring activities in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the liabilities related to these restructuring\nactivities were immaterial.\n18. Subsequent Events\nIn February 2023, the Company announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of\nshares of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $ 750million. This program is in addition to the prior\nrepurchase program for the repurchase of $ 400million shares of Class A common stock, which was completed in the\nthird quarter of 2022. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately\nnegotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors.\nOpen market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the\nExchange Act. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of\nour Class A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on\na variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment\nopportunities.\n119\nTable of Contents"

Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our Board\nof Directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition\noccurred. Our management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded Bbot, LLC (\"Bbot\") and\nWolt, which we acquired on March 1, 2022 and June 1, 2022, respectively. Total assets (excluding acquired goodwill\nand intangible assets) and total revenues related to Bbot and Wolt collectively represented approximately 5% and 4%\nof our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of\n120\nTable of Contents\ncompliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control\nsystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected."

                "content": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to achieve this by providing logistics, technology, and\nother services that reduce friction in local commerce and enable local businesses to address consumers’\nexpectations of ease, immediacy, quality, and affordability.\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), which operate\nin over 25 countries including the United States, and Platform Services. We built our Marketplaces to serve the\nneeds of three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and the independent contractors who use our platform to\ngenerate earnings, or \"Dashers 1 .\" Our Marketplaces enable merchants to establish an online presence and expand\ntheir reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. As part of our Marketplaces, we offer merchants a broad\narray of services that enable them to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand\ngeneration, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to\nadvertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales. Merchants can\nfulfill the demand generated on our Marketplaces through delivery, generally facilitated by our local commerce\nplatform, or in-person pickup by consumers.\nOur Marketplaces provide a platform for over 37 million monthly active users 2 to discover, engage with, and\npurchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value proposition\nby increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplaces, while also improving\nthe level of convenience, quality, service, and affordability we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our\nmembership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by\nreducing the delivery and service fees we charge consumers. As of December 31, 2023, we had over 18 million\nDashPass and Wolt+ members.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, which account for the vast majority of our revenue today, we offer services that\nhelp merchants build their own digital channels (\"Platform Services\"), primarily consisting of DoorDash Drive and\nWolt Drive (\"Drive\"), which are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated\nconsumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also\nincludes DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\"), which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering\nexperience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without\ninvesting in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities, and Bbot (\"Bbot\"), which offers merchants digital\nordering and payment solutions for their in-store and online channels.\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Platform Services provide highly accessible and flexible opportunities for people\nto generate income that helps them achieve their goals. Dashers choose if, when, and where to dash, as well as how\nfrequently and for how long to dash each time they choose to do so.\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents:\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with\na growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives\nincreased adoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, flexibility, choice, and earning\nopportunity that competes effectively for their time.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services.\n1 Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt\ncourier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2023.\n6\nTable of Contents\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and\nproducts available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, overall quality of the dashing\nexperience, and earnings potential.\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nGlobally, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway\n(including Grubhub, which it acquired in 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering\nplatforms, online ordering systems, other merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and\ngrocery delivery services, convenience and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point-\nof-sale solutions and merchant delivery services. We also compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such\nas take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising\nthat merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. With Drive, and as we continue to expand into\nother industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with additional businesses with substantial resources,\nusers, and market and brand power. As we continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face\ncompetition from local incumbents in these markets.\nFor additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “ Risk\nFactors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete\neffectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. ”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had over 19,300 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None\nof our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that\nour employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2023, well over 7 million people dashed 3 , earning a total of over $15 billion.\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors,\nwe must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities, other\nsources of capital like loans or credit cards, as well as alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure.\nBecause of this competition, we must make dashing attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices\navailable. Specifically, we strive to make dashing positive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers to entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law,\nprospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car.\nPeople who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We\nknow of no other earning opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs,\nschool, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\n3 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2023.\n7\nTable of Contents\nEarnings : Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with\nalternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of\nearnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by\nDashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ngeographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and\nretain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we\namplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the\ntools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have nine ERGs: AAPI@DoorDash, Able@DoorDash, Black@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, Parents@DoorDash,\nPride@DoorDash, Unidos@DoorDash, Veterans@DoorDash, and Women@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all\nbackgrounds.\nMitigating Bias Mandatory Training\nDuring our talent review cycles, we provide custom-designed training to all people managers, focused on educating\nleaders on unconscious bias, upskilling leaders on mitigation tactics, and creating accountability through a scaled\nBias Busters Program to ensure every room has a voice dedicating to mitigating bias. A self-guided online training\nis mandatory for people managers of all levels, and a live, instructor-led training course with practical\napplication exercises is mandatory for more senior leaders.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2023, we had 224 issued U.S. patents, 9 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions, 50 U.S. patent applications\npending, and 23 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts\nto assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2023, we held 53 registered trademarks in the United States and\n163 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\nall or part of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future;\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (our \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n10\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt Enterprises Oy (\"Wolt\");\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including with\nrespect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline and food costs;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have relatively limited\nhistorical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of\noperations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more\npredictable market. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations\ncould differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and\nwe may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $1.4\nbillion and $558 million in 2022 and 2023 , respectively, and as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 , we had an\naccumulated deficit of $3.8 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase over time and\nour losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business. We have\nexpended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our platform,\nincluding expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services, acquiring\nand integrating technologies and businesses, expanding into new markets and categories, and increasing our sales\nand marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in sufficient increased\nrevenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep\npace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving, maintaining, or increasing\nprofitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to\n11\nTable of Contents\nsuccessfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2023, we had $2.0\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards. We\nmay expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations that arise upon the\ninitial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nOur business has grown rapidly during various periods since our founding. Our past revenue growth rate, growth in\ndemand for our offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future\nperformance. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period\nas any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future\nperiods.\nIn particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the\nshort term and decline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market\nadoption. We may also experience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, and\nincreasing regulatory costs. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our\nbusiness, which may not result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our\nrevenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common\nstock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway (including Grubhub,\nwhich it acquired in 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and\nmerchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with additional\nbusinesses with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power. In addition, we compete with traditional\noffline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to\nconsumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. Further, as we\ncontinue to expand our presence internationally, we also face competition from local incumbents in these markets.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and suppliers, larger existing user bases, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, established geographic footprints and infrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical,\nand other resources than we have. For example, with grocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains\nthat have strong bargaining power, established relationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater\nfinancial resources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and\nefficiently to new or emerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may\nrender our platform less attractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a\nspecific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a\nsufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our\noffering would become less appealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish\ncooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, in\nJuly 2022, Grubhub announced a partnership with Amazon that allows Amazon Prime members in the United States to\nreceive a free trial of Grubhub's membership program. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with\ncompetitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Such\nefforts may lead us to lose category share or require us to increase our marketing expenses in order to maintain\nour category share.\n12\nTable of Contents\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services, consumer discounts and\npromotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of which may be more attractive\nthan those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to change our commission rates and fees or change\nour incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain competitive. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be\nsuccessful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of\nfunding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These\ninvestments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to\nlower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more\neffectively against us. Local on-demand delivery services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are\nnascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost-effective to\ndevelop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the\nlowest-cost provider and could use more than one local commerce platform, independent contractors who provide\ndelivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and merchants\ncould prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more than one\nplatform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as existing\nofferings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain of our\nplatform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than ours, which\nwould make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to cost-effectively grow our\nplatform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new\nmarkets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts\nmore merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has grown in\nthe past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to incur\nsubstantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to\nacquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may\ninvest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for\nseveral years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will\nultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any\nexclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection\navailable on our local commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our\nrelationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other\nconstituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how\ncompelling these offerings are to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership\nproducts. Additionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain\npromotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and\nofferings to\n13\nTable of Contents\nsuch consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our membership\nproducts, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other offerings.\nHowever, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our platform\nafter they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our consumers\nto regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform, demand for our\nfull-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or\ndecline.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the\nability to decline orders or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity\nprovisions with Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform and\ncompelling opportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase\ntheir use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or work stoppages that could\nadversely affect our users and our business. Relatedly, if merchants and consumers choose to use competing\nofferings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our\nplatform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other\nthings, invested in making the use of our Dasher applications, and dashing, as frictionless as possible, created\nnew ways for Dashers to earn and get paid, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, including credits to be\nused for orders on our platform, provided assistance using the Dasher applications, and offered access to programs\nthat provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, including gasoline. We also frequently test Dasher incentives\nwith subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain\nDashers or fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have unintended adverse\nconsequences, including negative press, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our\nbrand and reputation in both the U.S. and other markets. Changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration and labor and employment laws, or laws that require us to make changes to our platform that decrease\nthe flexibility provided to Dashers in certain markets, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may\nresult in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of\nour control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of\nDashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. If we fail to attract Dashers, retain\nexisting Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, we may\nnot be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods, meeting our requirements and\nstandards, or price their goods on our platform at unreasonable rates, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nAn increase in merchant operating costs, whether due to inflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our\nplatform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect\nour revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. Further, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\n14\nTable of Contents\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nthe mix among various aspects of our business, including our Marketplaces and Platform Services, our U.S. and\nnon-U.S. operations, our restaurant and non-restaurant categories, and contributions to our overall business by new\nproducts and services, such as our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and our advertising products;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe impact of weather and seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college\ncampuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response of governments\nand private industry;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural\ndisasters, power\n15\nTable of Contents\nlosses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks,\ncomputer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage,\ntheft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become increasingly difficult and\nexpensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of our platform, especially\nduring peak usage times, as our operations grow and the usage of our platform increases. Some of our systems are\nnot fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business\ninterruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our\nservice as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions that\ninterrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These events have\nresulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of revenue and may\nharm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our\nplatform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders\nthat are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar\nsuch credits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and\nsuch claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, we may not\nbe able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A\nprolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our\nplatform could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. For example, on May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Wolt.\nWe have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to evaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent\nmarkets and there is no assurance that such acquired businesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we\nenter into, will be successfully integrated into our business, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits\non a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies, operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts, and\npersonnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating internal controls, procedures, and policies and accounting, finance, and forecasting\npractices of acquired businesses with our own, especially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with foreign jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\n16\nTable of Contents\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, information security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition\nor other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operation, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or if\nthe transaction costs are greater than expected.\nIn particular, the integration of Wolt into our business poses heightened risks, including write-offs or\nrestructuring charges, unanticipated costs, regulatory and compliance risks associated with operating in a number\nof new jurisdictions, operational difficulties, and the loss of key employees. The acquisition of Wolt also\nsubjects us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the acquisition, some of which\nmay be unknown. Although we and our advisers conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt, there can be no\nguarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of Wolt. These liabilities, and any additional risks and\nuncertainties related to the acquisition not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or\nunlikely to occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including\nour profitability.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, we have\ninvested a total of $412 million in preferred shares of a private grocery delivery platform company based in\nEurope. Strategic investments inherently involve less control over business operations of the investee, thereby\npotentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, or compliance risks associated with the joint\nventure or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders,\nmanagement, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals\nthat are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners,\ncontrolling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value\nof our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation\nand brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable\nsecurities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities now or in the future may be\nsubject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign\ngovernment entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review\nmight limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-\nterm business strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments will generate returns for our\nbusiness, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, during the quarters\nended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, we recorded impairments of $312 million and $101 million,\nrespectively, associated with our non-marketable equity securities.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets,\narrangements, and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\nmarkets as part of our growth strategy. We currently operate in over 25 countries across the globe. Our operations\noutside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to oversee\noperations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition to\nplacing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our international\noperations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. markets subject us to a number of risks and we may not be\nsuccessful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\nan inability to recruit and retain talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintain our company\nculture across all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, Dashers, and consumers in non-U.S.\nmarkets;\ndifficulty complying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to\nlabor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment\nprocessing, transactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax laws, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions and cultural norms in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\nforeign currency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in which we operate\nor may operate in the future; and\nlimitations and differences in available instruments to invest our funds, including the risk profile associated\nwith such investments, and limitations on our ability to repatriate funds.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, Wolt's\noperations in markets that are in close proximity to Russia increase the difficulty in complying with trade and\neconomic sanction regimes related to business with Russia.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors, and we may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, many jurisdictions in which we operate\nhave introduced price control measures on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may be enacted\nin the future. These price controls have caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to\nconsumers. Our risks related to price controls are described in more detail under the section titled “— Our\nbusiness is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations .”\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There is no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we\npay to Dashers that utilize our platform, further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase\nour marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive\npressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher\nor consumer loyalty programs, such as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing\nmethodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower\ncommissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and\npricing methodologies may not be competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion\nmay require us to change our operations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including\nwith respect to consumer pricing and gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, as the products\nand services on our platform change, we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under a former\npay model for Dashers in the United States, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases\nwhen a consumer left little or no tip. Although this additional pay was intended to help Dashers by making every\ndelivery economically worthwhile, it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the\nmisimpression that not all tips were being received by Dashers. Government authorities have brought claims against\nus related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model and may bring similar claims in the future. We could face\nsimilar claims related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model from other government authorities in the future.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity or damage our reputation. For example, we increased the amount we pay to DoorDash Dashers per\norder when we changed our pay model in September 2019, but this pay model also causes less consistency in earnings\nacross deliveries in some cases. This pay model has resulted in, and in the future may result in, negative\npublicity related to perceptions of its complexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility\nin the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. In addition, in June 2023, we announced an option for Dashers in select cities\nto earn a guaranteed hourly rate while delivering. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal\nand regulatory changes and expansion into new categories and geographies, we may change our Dasher pay models\nagain. In particular, new or amended laws and regulations have required, and could in the future require, us to\nmake changes to our Dasher pay models, or make other changes to our platform, that\n19\nTable of Contents\ndecrease the flexibility provided to Dashers in certain markets, which may also impact our ability to cost-\neffectively attract or retain Dashers. Our current Dasher pay models, any changes made in response to new laws and\nregulations, and any future changes to our pay models or our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain\nDashers, could result in an increase to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform remain independent contractors, there is a risk\nthat Dashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or the laws of other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been involved in and\ncontinue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States, and\nsuch proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations\nWest, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in\nJune 2020. Certain risks related to reclassification of Dashers that use our platform are described in more detail\nunder the section titled “ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal\nor state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected .” A reclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to\nrevise our pricing methodologies and Dasher pay models to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and\nto make other substantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a subset of Dashers to employment\npositions, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. We have\nexperienced rapid employee headcount growth at our San Francisco headquarters, in a number of our offices across\nthe United States, internationally, and with employees working remotely globally. We have also expanded our\npresence, both in employee headcount and operationally, in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of Wolt. This\ngrowth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of our rapid\ngrowth, including at Wolt and other companies we may acquire, could result in errors in our financial statements\nthat could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could negatively impact our stock price. We\nwill need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in order to manage our business\neffectively and accurately report our results of operations. Similarly, our failure to implement and maintain\neffective data and information security systems with respect to our platform as we grow could result in breaches,\nsecurity incidents, theft or fraud, service disruptions, loss of user confidence in our platform, legal claims,\nregulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation or brand, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform. Similarly, maintaining and\nenhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be particularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia.\nSuccessfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network\neffects of our platform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent,\nhigh-quality services and support, and our ability to\n20\nTable of Contents\nsuccessfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos, and other\ntrademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We\nbelieve that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in\nturn drives new user growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective.\nOur users have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local commerce platforms and\nservices, and consumer preferences may also change. To expand our user base, we must appeal to new users who may\nhave historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be adversely affected\nby complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize our platform or\nour competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect of negative\npublicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are disseminated\nvia social media platforms. Any such expressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to\nbe unfounded or successfully resolved without direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand,\nreputation, and local network effects. Negative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nincluding highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including\nDasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee couriers or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, or inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\n21\nTable of Contents\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, Dasher pay models, user\nsupport, technology, platform policies, platform changes, platform or other quality issues, delivery issues,\nprivacy or security practices, management team, compliance with laws and regulations, or the health and safety of\nDashers, employee couriers, merchants, and consumers using our platform could adversely affect our reputation. Such\nnegative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and loyalty of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which\nDashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general\nfood safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform,\nwhich has adversely affected our reputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands,\ninfluencers, or other third parties that we have partnered with or may partner with in the future may damage our\nreputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we may receive could\ndiminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and\nproprietary data relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our\nemployees. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external\nactors or with our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an\nexternal party or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current\ngeopolitical environment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors or state-\naffiliated actors, which could target businesses. These incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems, which can\nbe leveraged to access our websites, platforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors have\npreviously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported an\nincident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers\nand Dashers. In addition, in December 2021, we investigated and patched Log4j vulnerabilities that, if exploited,\ncould have allowed for unauthorized remote code execution in our systems. We have undertaken steps to enhance our\ndata security and governance program, which include adding security layers around data, improving access controls,\nhiring additional personnel with data security experience, and using outside expertise to identify and repel\nthreats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of these incidents have been identified and remediated or\nwill not lead to recurrence or other incidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or exfiltrate data from information systems\nchange frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable\nto anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate detective or preventive\nmeasures, and we and our vendors may face delays in our response to or remediation of breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means. In addition, there may be attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants,\nconsumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other\nsensitive information resulting in account takeovers or the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the\nprevalence of remote work, we may also be exposed to increased risks of breaches or incidents via such methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to monitor and protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures\nhave not fully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and\ninfrastructure may\n22\nTable of Contents\nbe vulnerable to viruses, social engineering, denial of service, credential stuffing, ransomware and other malware,\ninsecure third-party libraries, application or network vulnerabilities, reliance on third-party vendors for\npatches, unauthorized configurations, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption, and, as a\nresult, unauthorized parties may be able to access our systems and data, including personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data, through our systems. Although we have policies and technical controls restricting\nthe access to and sharing of the data we store, as well as requiring encryption of data where appropriate, these\npolicies and controls may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or similar incident could\ninterrupt our operations, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, result in our platform being\nunavailable, loss or improper access to, or unavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory\ninvestigations, proceedings, and significant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such incidents or any\nperception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence\nin, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at, or\nsuffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence\nin us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident, impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures and respond to any incidents impacting them is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant\nsupply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they\ndo not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other\ndisruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance that may help provide\ncoverage for these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will\nbe adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any\nfuture claim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or\nchanges in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nThe on-demand local commerce category is still in relatively early stages of growth, and if this category does not\ncontinue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is still\nrelatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. The markets\nfor certain services we facilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories,\nmay be in even earlier stages of development than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for\nthese services will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance, if at all. In addition, through our\nacquisition of Wolt, we have entered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce\ncategory may be at different stages of market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the\nwillingness of people to widely adopt on-demand local commerce platforms. Changing traditional ordering habits is\ndifficult, and if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local commerce platforms as we\nexpect, including as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a\nresult of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopt alternative\nsolutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop slower than we\nexpect, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may negatively impact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are\nconsistent with our goals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results\nover the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and\nmay not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are impersonating consumers or Dashers, have occurred, and in the\nfuture may occur, which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese activities include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery,\nassault, battery, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, registering Dasher accounts\nwith us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities may result\nin physical injury, loss of life, property damage, and financial damage for consumers and third parties, and\nbusiness interruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card, debit card, or bank account information, fraud with respect to background checks,\nfraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, exploitation of system bugs or\nvulnerabilities to circumvent payment requirements, account takeovers of merchant, consumer, or Dasher accounts by\nbad actors, and other unauthorized uses of another person's identity. For example, bad actors have created Dasher\naccounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying information for illicit purposes. Among other things, in\nthe United States, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services\nas Dashers. In addition, under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our\nplatform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card\ntransaction.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, these measures may\nnot adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring or scale efficiently with our business and such\nconduct could expose us to liability, including through litigation or regulatory action, or adversely affect our\nbrand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or\notherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check where\npermitted by applicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good\nstanding from using our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and\ntransparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors do not adopt similar measures, the\ngrowth of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected. In\naddition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which enables merchants on our\nMarketplaces to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are retained directly by\nmerchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in any of the other\nactivities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Any negative publicity\nrelated to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, or the measures we adopt\nto mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a whole, which\ncould negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. In\naddition, measures have been enacted in many U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local\ncommerce platforms like ours from facilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent.\nWe have adopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for\ndelivery on our platform in the United States and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nus. However, we continue to add non-partner merchants\n24\nTable of Contents\nin categories other than restaurants. We may continue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-\npartner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants\nfor any reason, this may adversely affect our ability to provide a broad selection of merchants on our platform,\nattract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. To compete\neffectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable merchant and consumer experience on our\nplatform, and we may be unable to effectively address merchant and consumer needs or identify emerging consumer\ntrends. If competitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices or consumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may\nbecome less popular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone\ndelivery technologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or\ndrone delivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our\npartners’ technology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend on\nour ability to invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our personnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not\ngenerate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging\nindustry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if\nour recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses,\nincluding DashMart and Wolt Market. To build and expand our self-operated businesses, including DashMart and Wolt\nMarket, we have made substantial investments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for\nin-store products, establishing supply-related contractual partnerships, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and\nrolling out relevant technologies and processes. We also plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the\nfuture. The maintenance and expansion of our self-operated businesses requires significant investments, and there\nis no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and\nWolt Market, we may not be able to generate a sufficient number of orders to cover our fixed costs and make such\nservices viable in certain locations and we may incur significant costs before we can determine the viability of\nthese DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-operated retail locations also expose us to different regulatory\nrequirements and risks than our Marketplaces and Platform Services, in particular with respect to food safety,\npermit and license requirements, and zoning restrictions. Our expansion into convenience, grocery, and other retail\ncategories, may also result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business opportunities as well as\nthe diversion of resources from support functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business, and attracting merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and we may not generate a meaningful return on these\ninitiatives. Even if we increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the\nadditional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective, we\nexpect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\n25\nTable of Contents\nadversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the gains in efficiency\nto our platform that we expect. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number\nof risks, including changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost-\neffectiveness of our platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do\nnot reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are\nunable to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency,\nDasher pay, and defective orders, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nqualified to support users of our platform and well versed in our platform. As we continue to grow our business and\nimprove our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support services at scale.\nAdditionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of non-U.S. based users on our\nplatform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering\nsupport in languages other than English and in ways consistent with the customs and dominant technologies used in\nthe various geographies in which we operate. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception\nthat we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to scale\nour platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of\nthe calendar year, although our rapid growth in historical periods has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder or more\ninclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand. In\ncontrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather when we need\nmore Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we typically rely\non incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs.\nFurther, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it impossible to fulfill\ndeliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we\nexperience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation\nperiods, causing adverse effects to our business during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause\nfluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the\nexisting seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in\nour results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our\nresults of operations and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges to economic conditions can impact consumer spending in the regions where we do business, which can prompt\nconsumers to reduce spending on our platform or forgo spending on our platform altogether. Any factor that impacts\nconsumer spending broadly may also impact consumer spending on our platform. Some of these factors include\n26\nTable of Contents\nunemployment, inflation, consumer debt, fluctuations in household net worth, fluctuations in gasoline, vehicle, and\ntransportation costs, increased food costs, fluctuations in commodity prices, declines in asset prices, residential\nreal estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, changes in interest rates and credit availability,\nchanges in saving rates, and consumer confidence in the current and future political and economic environment.\nEconomic conditions in certain regions may also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally,\nvolatility in the global financial markets, or in specific segments of those markets, may contribute to banks and\nfinancial institutions with whom we have banking or payment processing relationships entering receivership or\nbecoming insolvent in the future, and we may be unable to access or may lose some or all of our existing cash and\ncash equivalents to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or other insurance programs. Such volatility may also adversely impact any funds held temporarily at\nour third-party payment processors.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our\nPlatform Services. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact\nconsumer demand and drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Platform Services. Small businesses\nthat do not have substantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely\naffected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small\nbusiness merchants, cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business\ndisruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely\nto use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse global economic and\npolitical conditions, including the wars between Israel and Hamas, and Russia and Ukraine. Both these conflicts\nhave had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in the region and give rise to\nvolatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and Dashers on\nour platform.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new geographic markets and categories in which we have\nlimited or no prior operating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new geographic markets and categories. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately\npredict consumer preferences and purchasing habits in these new geographic markets and categories. In addition,\neach market and category has unique regulatory dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or\nindirectly affect our ability to operate, the pool of Dashers that are available, and other operational costs. In\naddition, each market and category is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our\nability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and\nretain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business\nmetrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in\nthe geographic markets and categories in which we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand\nour operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Information on risks associated with entry into new markets internationally\nare described in more detail under the section titled “— Our international operations and any future international\nexpansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful. ” Information on risks\nassociated with entry into certain new categories are described in more detail under the section titled “— We face\ncertain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses .”\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in foreign countries. When\nconducting business in foreign countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country, which exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is currently to the euro,\nthe Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, and the Australian dollar. Additionally, because our financial statements\nare presented in U.S. dollars, local functional currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable\nexchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements, thereby increasing our foreign exchange translation risk.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity, which\nmay reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and\nequity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train,\nand integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\"). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, and any failure\nto do so could impact our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\nexcessive number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return\nto our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not\neffectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and\n29\nTable of Contents\nanticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected.\nWe may use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\nreputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services, and features,\nor in support of internal business operations, and these applications may become important in our operations over\ntime. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more\nsuccessfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of\noperations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are\nor are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, inappropriate, or biased, or if the use of AI results in, or is alleged\nto have resulted in, the infringement of the intellectual property of third parties, we may be subject to legal\nclaims or liability and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The\nuse of AI applications may result in data leakage or unauthorized exposure of data, including confidential business\ninformation, the personal data of end users, or other sensitive information. Such leakage or unauthorized exposure\nof data related to our use of AI applications could result in legal claims or liability or otherwise adversely\naffect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of AI\nbecomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. The\nrapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, may require significant resources to\ndevelop, test, and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI in a manner\nthat complies with applicable laws and regulations and ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and\navailability of our platform, as well as other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by\nmalicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach\nor other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze,\ncorrect, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to\ntimely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result\nin dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax withholding\nliabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting or settlement\nof RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued with respect\nto such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have the holders of\nsuch RSUs use a broker to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement date, with the\nproceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in order to satisfy\nsuch tax withholding and remittance obligations, which is generally referred to as \"sell-to-cover,\" or (iii) allow\ncertain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker, sufficient to cover the applicable RSU tax\nwithholding obligations. If we withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued with\nrespect to the vesting or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax\nobligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We have implemented “sell-to-cover” to satisfy\ntax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding\nobligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding\nliability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Such sales or any\ncash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding obligations, in either case,\nwill not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs,\nbut will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number of shares are sold in connection with\nany vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required by\nregulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as required\nby Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified\nby any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to\ndifferences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a\nnumber of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we\nuse to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors,\nthe data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our\nplatform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by\nfraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even\nthough this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior.\nConsumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition,\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect\nour understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating\nmetrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be\naccurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in\nour operating metrics and business and we expect that we could be subject to legal claims, including securities\nclass action lawsuits, and our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions\nand insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive\nmodeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our financial statements. If we determine that our estimated\ninsurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination,\nwhich could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively\nimpact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in\njurisdictions in Europe and Asia, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as\nindependent contractors. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors\nvary by jurisdiction and are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can\ncreate uncertainty and unpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and consumers that use our\nplatform. For example, in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor released a final rule regarding the\nclassification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which\nimplements new interpretative guidance for classification of workers.\nWhile we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors,\nDashers may be reclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on worker\nclassification and their potential impact on the local commerce industry. A reclassification of Dashers as\nemployees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a\nresult of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to PAGA and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability to add and retain Dashers to our platform\nand grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought,\nfor example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. For more details on this\naction, please see the section titled \" Legal Proceedings \" above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, and Asia have modified, or are considering modifying, their\nstandards used to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill\n(\"AB 5\") and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January\n1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and\ncreated numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22\n(“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in\nNovember 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court\nin California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney\nGeneral and other groups and individuals appealed to the California First District Court of Appeal. In March 2023,\nthe Court of Appeal overturned the Alameda County Superior Court’s ruling and upheld nearly all of Proposition 22\nas state law. In April 2023, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a petition\nfor review in the Supreme Court of California, which was granted in June 2023. To the extent Proposition 22 remains\nin effect, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain\n32\nTable of Contents\nother requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California. These provisions have increased our costs\nrelated to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge\nhigher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much\nwe choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin,\ndefined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. As such, Proposition 22 has had, and may continue\nto have, an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate have adopted or may be considering, or in the future may consider,\nadopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or\nvoluntary agreements with third parties, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections\nand benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation,\nballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or agreements, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if it becomes\nnecessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely affect our results\nof operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation. If Dashers are determined to be employees under U.S. federal\nor state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including as a result of litigation, this\ncould result in increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and\ncommissions and may result in lower order volumes, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration (through\nthe Division at the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland) issued a decision which deemed that\nWolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that Wolt should be mandated to\nkeep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. We have appealed the decision to the Administrative\nCourt of Hämeenlinna. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the standards used to determine\nworker classification, which may impact the classification of Dashers using our platform. For example, the EU is\nconsidering a new mechanism for determining worker classification, which would be applied by member states if\nadopted, and may involve differing implementation by the various member states. Any potential EU-wide legislative\nreform may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent contractor model within the EU.\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, we may\ndecide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result in certain operational\nchallenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain jurisdictions or decide not to expand our\nbusiness in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands, and other legal, regulatory, and\nother administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker\nclassification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints,\nintellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits,\ngovernment investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by merchants and Dashers that utilize our platform. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any\ninjuries to, or deaths of, any consumers, Dashers, employees, or third parties could result in negative publicity\nand harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well.\n33\nTable of Contents\nFurther, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that generate a significant\npercentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The potential for acts of\nterrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs, it could harm\nour business and results of operations. Further, food and other products that are ordered through our platform\ncould be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a recall. In\naddition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food and other product recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our\nplatform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher,\nincluding our background check processes, removal of platform access, and the nature and frequency of our\ncommunications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims,\nincluding class actions, by consumers relating to, among other things, disclosures we make with respect to sales\ntax, consumer fees, and gratuities, the local delivery fulfillment services we facilitate, discrepancies between\nthe items on our websites and consumer applications and the items advertised at the merchants from which such items\nare delivered, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or\ntelephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement. Finally, we face potential\nliability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our websites and mobile\napplications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and negligence, among\nothers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands,\nor other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us,\nwhether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation,\nrequire significant management attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one\nor more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending\nlitigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation.\nThere is no guarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings\ncould also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders\nrequiring a change in our business practices. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other\nlegal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and\ncurrent and former directors and officers. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or\nbe required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which\ncould also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n34\nTable of Contents\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations or liabilities on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or\nliabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain and could exceed the amount of any applicable reserves, if any. In addition\nto our own potential liability, if we or merchants pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to\nconsumers, order volume may decline.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and\nremit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our\ncalculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do\nnot currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, including tax on the cost of goods sold, and could\nimpose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect\ntaxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which\nwe currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as\npenalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could\notherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting\ntaxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and\nremit such taxes.\nThe United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner. Certain risks relating to employment taxes are described in more\ndetail under the section titled \"— If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S.\nfederal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations would be adversely affected. \"\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which could result in legislative\naction to increase indirect taxes, including digital services taxes. Such legislative action could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for (benefit\nfrom) income taxes is a function of the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations\nor laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. The determination of our worldwide\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management\nand, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate\ntax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is\nreasonable, the ultimate outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could\nmaterially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business operations,\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes in our stock price, intercompany\ntransactions, changes in law or administrative interpretations thereof, changes in accounting principles, changes\nto our forecasts of income and loss, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\n35\nTable of Contents\nLegislative changes or administrative practices may increase our tax obligations and exposures and could adversely\naffect our business results and operations.\nThe U.S. federal, state, and local governments, countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and\norganizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes\nto existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If\none or more of these jurisdictions change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge our interpretations of such\nlaws, including how or where our profits and losses are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and\nour business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAn increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose\nnew tax measures, including revenue-based taxes and additional reporting obligations, targeting online commerce and\nthe remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption,\nvalue added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in\nliability for third party obligations. Non-U.S. jurisdictions have also proposed or enacted taxes on gross revenue\nderived from, for example, sales of online advertising services and the provision of digital intermediary services\nsuch as the operation of online marketplaces. Proliferation of these or similar tax measures may continue unless\nbroader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively, or additional taxes or penalties\nresulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our\ncustomers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some\ncases, we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply\nwith new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWhile federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to\nexpiration, the deductibility of such NOL carryforwards is limited to 80% of our federal taxable income. Our state\nand foreign NOLs have varying expiration dates beginning in 2024. Utilization of our NOL carryforwards depends on\nour future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing NOL carryforwards and tax credits in\nvarious jurisdictions could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future\ntaxable income. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n“Code”), loss utilization is limited if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a\ngreater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of\nstockholders over a three-year period. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience\nownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs a result, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal\ntaxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in\nincreased future tax liability to us.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, Dasher deactivations, insurance, merchant pricing and\ncommissions, consumer fees, and taxes. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as worker\nclassification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay and\ninsurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other\nhighly regulated products, online payments, gratuities, merchant pricing and commissions, text messaging,\nmembership products, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data sharing, data security, consumer\nprotection, consumer fees, antitrust, background checks, website and mobile application accessibility,\nenvironmental sustainability and related disclosures, and tax and other government-imposed fees are often complex,\nsubject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. The\nscope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be\nconflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between U.S. law and the laws of other countries,\nbetween U.S. state and federal law, between individual states, and even at the city and municipality level. As a\nresult, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance\nor interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and local laws\nregulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products. These regulations and\nlaws may dictate matters such as licensing, permitting, or other governmental review requirements, advertising\nrestrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our operations\nresulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or changes to the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or regulations could\nresult in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of highly regulated products in a\njurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased sales or marketing costs, or changes to our business\npractices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, particularly\nfollowing our acquisition of Wolt, we have become subject to a growing array of laws and regulations, which\nincrease the complexity and compliance risk inherent in our business. For example, the EU has recently enacted, and\nis in the process of enacting, various laws and regulations that govern digital services and markets and impose\nenvironmental sustainability obligations and disclosure requirements on businesses like ours. The impact of these\nnew regulations on the overall industry, business models, and our operations is uncertain. We may be required to\nenhance our disclosures and undertake certain changes to our products, services, fees and commissions structure,\nand operations as a result of these new requirements, which could subject us to increased administrative costs.\nIn recent years, regulatory scrutiny of larger companies, technology companies, and companies engaged in dealings\nwith independent contractors has increased. As a result, regulatory and administrative bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and\nregulations differently than they have in the past in a manner adverse to our business, including by changing\nemployment-related laws, mandating specific earning standards for Dashers, requiring businesses like ours to\nmaintain specific auto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses like ours agree\nto with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in December 2023, a New York City rule\nmandating certain minimum earnings standards for food delivery workers took effect. In addition, many jurisdictions\nin which we operate have price control measures in effect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such\nmeasures may be enacted in the future. These price control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar\nregulations have caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers. To the extent\nthat price control measures, minimum earnings standards, or similar regulations lead to an increase in the fees we\ncharge to consumers, consumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and\nresults of operations. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge or seek to regulate the way in which we\ncategorize, disclose, or collect consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged\nsuch fees as confusing or misleading to consumers.\nIn addition, there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment regarding antitrust and\ncompetition matters in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We could be subject to claims\nof violations of competition laws in many aspects of our business, including alleged market sharing, price fixing,\nexchange of competitively sensitive information, and with respect to any acquisitions we undertake. For example,\ncompetition authorities in some of the markets in which Wolt operates have made queries regarding, or investigated,\nWolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices and competition authorities and courts have issued decisions\nconcerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms and practices. Any potential violations of competition laws could result in\nlitigation, fines, restrictions on our operations, render applicable provisions or contracts unenforceable, divert\nmanagement’s attention, and lead to claims for damages and reputational harm, each of which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and\nregulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a\nresult of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth\nof our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person,\n37\nTable of Contents\nor gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for acts of corruption and bribery committed by\nour third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are acting on our behalf. We and our third-party\nbusiness partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and\nemployees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or\nother illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries and our employees,\nrepresentatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In addition, we\nmay be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to satisfy certain requirements under\nanti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and ongoing due diligence standards. For\nexample, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for penalties of up to 10% of our revenue\nin a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance measures are found to be insufficient. All\nof these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address\ncompliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of\nour policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating\nthese laws increases as our international presence expands, including as a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and\nas we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-\nbribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media\ncoverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil\nsanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s\nattention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define money transmitter\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider for its payment\nservices to merchants in European Economic Area (\"EEA\") countries and has obtained a payment institution license\nfrom the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II. Should our payment institution license\nbe revoked in the future, or any other enforcement measures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory\nAuthority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease offering certain payment facilities, our operations in\nEurope would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand into new jurisdictions, the payment-related\nregulations that we are subject to will expand as well. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with\napplicable rules and regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings,\nforfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant\nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt\nour ability to operate in certain jurisdiction and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media\nmarketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer\nprotection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not\nalways clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and\npersonal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is\npossible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or\nwebsites or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived\nfailure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand,\na loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n38\nTable of Contents\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, process, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as\nwell as other personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state,\nfederal, national, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing,\nuse, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data and require the notification of certain security breaches\ninvolving personal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change\nthrough new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be\ninconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any changes in these laws or regulations could add further\ncomplexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of resources in\ncompliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in business practices\nand policies. For example, requirements around consumer health data may restrict our ability to provide\npersonalized content on our platform. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in our\nefforts to comply with current and evolving privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nApplicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property and the personal data of our\nusers. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December 2021 that would require us to\nprovide consumer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and delivery addresses to restaurant\nmerchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a consumer opts out. This could result in consumers\nreceiving unsolicited communications from merchants, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have\nfiled a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the\npendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect\non our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe are increasingly subject to additional laws relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity as we expand\nour international operations. For example, with our acquisition of Wolt, we expanded our potential for liability\nunder the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which imposes strict requirements relating to the\nprocessing of personal data as well as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against the processing of\npersonal data, and civil litigation claims for noncompliance.\nWe rely on legal mechanisms for transferring personal data subject to GDPR. In 2020, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield\nFramework was invalidated in the Schrems II case by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has created\nsignificant challenges in using other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data from the EEA to other\ncountries. Although the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, a self-certification program that facilitates cross-\nborder transfers of personal data by U.S. companies in compliance with EU law, became effective in July 2023, we\nmay experience difficulties in self-certification, its implementation, and compliance, including as a result of\nnon-compliance by certain of our counterparties. The uncertainty around data transfers and global trends relating\nto national data localization could continue to present risks with respect to non-compliance, as well as increased\ncosts to comply with complex and evolving requirements.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be contractually\nrequired to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the\ncosts or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy,\ndata protection, information security, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part on our ability to access, collect, and use data relating to Dashers,\nmerchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is further\nrestricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, and other practices, the amount or accuracy of Internet\nuser information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations that\nsignificantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the use of\nonline tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem.\nMoreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as Apple and Google, plan to or have\nimplemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking technologies or to require new permissions\nfrom users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of such\npractices and technologies. As a result, we may have to develop alternative systems to determine our customers’\nbehavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently market to them.\n39\nTable of Contents\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or\ncybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal\ndata or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the perception of privacy\nconcerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation and\nbrand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our platform, or result in fines,\ninvestigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to legal claims resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to certain risks, including liabilities or\nclaims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \"TCPA\")\nrestricts telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and\nmay in the future result, in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be\napplicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we are not able to comply\nwith these laws and regulations, including the TCPA, in an effective manner, we could be subject to legal claims\nand liability, our brand and reputation may be harmed, and our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data\nbreaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general\nbusiness liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving\nservices, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. Even if we do acquire insurance for our\noperations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, we may not obtain enough insurance to\nadequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for\nthe coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any\noperations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers terminate their relationship\nwith us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to\nfind alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an\nacceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of\ninsurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of\nthese merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and\ndeductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could\nincrease substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are\nrenewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if\n(i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and\ncoverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to\npay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of\nclaims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”),\na third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We do not have control\nover the\n40\nTable of Contents\noperations of the AWS facilities that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from\nnatural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of\nmisconduct. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will continue to experience, interruptions,\ndelays, and outages in service and availability due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes,\nhuman or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS's\nservice levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on our platform. Any negative\npublicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand. Since our platform’s continuing and\nuninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the\nattractiveness of our platform, usage of our platform, lead to loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our\nability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur primary commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated under certain circumstances. Both\nAWS and we may terminate the agreement only for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, provided the\nterminating party gives prior written notice and a 30-day period to cure the material breach. Although it would be\ndifficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event that our agreement\nwith AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant\ncosts or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud\ninfrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud\ninfrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations over the longer term.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily Stripe and\nPayPal. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, anti-money laundering,\nand similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors, we may be subject\nto claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher\ntransaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could\nmake our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe and other\npayment service provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other\nerrors in such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to\ncomply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The\npayment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that\nmight prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If\nwe fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose\nour ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed\nto reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by\npayment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on accredited third-party background check providers to provide the\ncriminal or driving history of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that\nare not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be\nadversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the\nrequirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to\nfind alternate providers, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\ntime frame. In certain jurisdictions, including Canada, we currently rely on a single third-party background check\nprovider. In other jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a very limited number of background check\nproviders. If the need arises, and we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms\nacceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less\nattractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further,\nif the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise\nmeet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform and, as a result, we\nmay be unable to adequately help protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers. Conversely,\ninaccurate background checks may inadvertently exclude qualified Dashers from our platform. As a result of\ninaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-\nparty background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be\npermitted to continue making deliveries on our platform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including lawsuits, inquiries, and demand letters, related\nto our background check review process and the notice requirements around background checks. In addition,\nbackground check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws,\nand our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information\nthat could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. If we\nchoose background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or if we fail to run additional background checks after Dashers are onboarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe depend on the functionality of our platform across third-party software and services that we do not control.\nWe have integrations with PayPal, Stripe, Olo, Google Maps, AWS, and a variety of other third-party vendors. Third-\nparty software, applications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or\nmodify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings. Updates to third party software that\nintegrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously had or at\nall. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the\ninteroperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our\nability to operate and distribute our platform. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our\nplatform or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our platform.\nIn certain markets, we regularly engage fleet companies to fulfill deliveries on our platform. Fleet companies are\nthird parties that provide delivery services using their own workforce. Our operations in some markets may be\nheavily dependent on the services of fleet companies. To the extent that we do become reliant on fleet companies in\ncertain markets, it may be difficult to find a suitable replacement for the fulfillment services that such fleet\ncompanies provide in a timely manner or at all. In the event that our relationship with any of our key partners,\nincluding fleet companies,\n42\nTable of Contents\ndeteriorates, whether as a result of business disputes, regulatory issues, or degrading quality of services, we may\nexperience difficulties maintaining our operations in impacted markets, which could adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, in 2021, Apple imposed\nrequirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and implemented an application tracking\ntransparency framework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google\nannounced it planned to adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes\nhave, and we expect that these changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and\npromotions. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the\ngrowth of new users as well as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through Internet search results on search engines\nlike Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and\nwhere our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its\nranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not\nbe prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We\n43\nTable of Contents\nrely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect\nour intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and\nconfidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual property on our behalf\nto enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we share information with to\nenter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of\nour confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the\nevent of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or technology, or infringement of our\nintellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects\nof our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider\nproprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or successfully endeavor, to obtain our\nintellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through various methods, including through\ncybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be inadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly\nleading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims\nbrought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and\nabroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and\nscope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or\nregister our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce\nour proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, such as www.doordash.com and\nwww.wolt.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the\napplicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name,\nwhich could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain\nname in question. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names due to a variety of reasons. In addition, our\ncompetitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours.\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to,\nor otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting, maintaining, and\nenforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and\ndiversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source\nsoftware license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and\ntime and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected\nportions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and\nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software\nuntil we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nThere have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of\nwhat we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the\nterms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be\nrequired to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-\nengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our\nproprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. We may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, or\ninvestments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-\nlinked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and\nany new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our\nClass A common stock. We may evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain\nfinancing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance\nand the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional\nfinancing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms\nsatisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to\nbusiness challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be\nadversely affected.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere were no revolving loans outstanding and $115 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued\nunder our revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2023, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,\nand a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of\nour board of directors collectively held 59% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate,\nwhich voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards\n(including those equity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering and subject to\nequity exchange right agreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us\nto exchange any shares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A\ncommon stock or the vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent\nnumber of shares of Class B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO\nPerformance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31,\n2023, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 69% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-\nFounders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable\nproxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their\nrespective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by\nstockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the\napproval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or\nour Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no\n46\nTable of Contents\nless than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the number of shares of our capital\nstock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, and any shares of capital\nstock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities and\npermitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities as of\nimmediately following the completion of our initial public offering, which we sometimes refer to herein as the \"35%\nOwnership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Xu, during which\n12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person designated by Mr. Xu\nand approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person, then our secretary then in office); (iii)\nthe date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date\non which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation); or\n(iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the\ndate upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr.\nXu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a\nresult of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a\nmember of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all outstanding shares of\nClass B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation occurs as the\n\"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would\nhave no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting\ndilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common\nstock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares\nof Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has\nbeen met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\ncontrol of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our\nCo-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve\nliquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C\ncommon stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of\nNasdaq.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of Nasdaq, we\nexpect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain\nreduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2023, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of Nasdaq. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for\nthe election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may\nelect not to comply with certain listing standards of Nasdaq regarding corporate governance, including requirements\nthat a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, a compensation committee be composed of\nindependent directors, and that there is independent director oversight over the director nomination process.\nSuch corporate governance requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the\n“controlled company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely\non these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the protections for other\nstockholders.\n47\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Under such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible\nfor inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. It is unclear what\neffect, if any, these policies will have on the long-term valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from\nsuch indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are\nincluded. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices,\nexclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our\nClass A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock\ncould be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\n48\nTable of Contents\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nWe have authorized share repurchase programs in the past and may authorize other share repurchase programs in the\nfuture. Under existing or any future share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of\nmethods, including open share market purchases, block transactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in\naccordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not\nobligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and\nwithout prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price,\nmarket and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements, such as Delaware surplus and\nsolvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have\nannounced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may\nnegatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour\n49\nTable of Contents\namended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make\nthe acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in\n50\nTable of Contents\na judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may\ndiscourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The enforceability of similar\nchoice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it\nis possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. For example, in\nDecember 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal\ndistrict courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court in March 2020,\ncourts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find\nthe exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action,\nwe may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment."

We have an\nenterprise-wide information security program that is designed to identify, protect, detect, and respond to\nreasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risk and threats, and continuously work to enhance and improve our\ncybersecurity and risk management efforts. We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats and\nmaintain incident response plans designed to protect, identify, evaluate, respond to, and recover from a\ncybersecurity incident. The plans are designed to be flexible so that they may be adapted to an array of potential\nscenarios, and provide for the creation of cross-functional cybersecurity incident response teams in the event of a\ncybersecurity incident. We regularly conduct exercises to help ensure our overall preparedness for a cybersecurity\nincident.\nWe also have invested in tools and technologies to protect our data and information technology, and we monitor our\nsystems on an ongoing basis to identify and assess risk. In addition, we have implemented a mandatory cybersecurity\ntraining and awareness program designed to educate and train employees on how to identify and report cybersecurity\nthreats. We also provide specialized training for employees in more sensitive roles.\nWe take measures to assess and, where warranted, update and improve our cybersecurity program, including by\nregularly conducting internal risk assessments, internal control validations, independent program assessments,\nthreat assessments, penetration testing, and scanning of our systems for vulnerabilities. Our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement framework is based on applicable laws and regulations, as well as industry recognized standards and\npractices. We undergo periodic third-party assessments against recognized industry standards and practices,\nincluding an annual\n51\nTable of Contents\npayment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment card information.\nWe also periodically engage third-party advisors to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program, policies\nand practices, consult with external advisors regarding opportunities and enhancements to strengthen our policies\nand practices, and assess our cybersecurity capabilities using third-party security firms. Our internal audit team\nprovides independent assessment of our cybersecurity program and controls.\nWith respect to third-party service providers, our information security program includes conducting due diligence\nand vendor risk assessment of relevant service providers’ information security programs prior to onboarding, as\nwell as ongoing monitoring through DoorDash’s third-party risk management policy and program. We also contractually\nrequire third-party service providers with access to our information technology systems, sensitive business data,\nor personal information to implement and maintain appropriate security controls and provide for contractual\nrestrictions on their ability to use our data. We work with these third-party service providers to help ensure\ntheir cybersecurity protocols are appropriate to the risk presented by their access to or use of our systems and/or\ndata, including notification and coordination concerning incidents occurring on third-party systems that may affect\nus. Our service providers are contractually required to notify us promptly of information security incidents that\nmay affect our systems or data, including personal information.\nTo date, risks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected our business or operations. Although we have\ninvested in the protection of our data and information technology, and monitor our systems on an ongoing basis,\nthere can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful in preventing our information technology systems\nfrom being compromised or otherwise protecting us completely from security breaches or incidents. For additional\ninformation regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity\nincidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, please see the section titled \"Risk Factors,\" in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “ Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and\nOperations—We have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future\nattacks. Any actual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our\noperations, harm our brand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and\nadversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations .”\nGovernance\nOur board of directors has risk oversight responsibility for DoorDash and administers this responsibility both\ndirectly and with assistance from its committees. Our board of directors has designated our audit committee to\nadminister oversight of cybersecurity risk management, which is a critical component of our enterprise risk\nmanagement program. As such, our audit committee receives regular updates on our cybersecurity program and is\nactively involved in reviewing our information security and technology risks and opportunities, risk mitigation\nstrategies, incident and industry trends, areas of emerging risks, and other areas of importance, including with\nrespect to cybersecurity. Security updates are also provided to the full board of directors from time to time.\nDoorDash’s cybersecurity program is led by its Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who is responsible for\nassessing and managing information security and technology risks and reports to the General Counsel. He has worked\nin security and technology for over 20 years, with the last 10 years spent in security leadership. He holds a B.S.\nin Computer Science from University of Illinois Springfield. Including DoorDash, he has held a CISO role at four\ncompanies within the technology and e-commerce spaces. Wolt’s cybersecurity program is led by a Vice President of\nSecurity, who is responsible for assessing and managing information security, technology, and physical security and\nsafety risks, and reports to the Chief Executive Officer of Wolt. He has worked in security and technology for over\n30 years. Their teams are composed of experienced personnel with a broad range of experience across the technology\nindustry.\nManagement is responsible for assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks, and both\nDoorDash’s CISO and Wolt’s Vice President of Security and their teams meet regularly with each other and with\nmembers of management to review and evaluate our cybersecurity risks and risk management program. As part of its\noversight of cybersecurity risks, our audit committee receives regular updates on the risks and status of both the\nDoorDash and Wolt security programs, including from the DoorDash CISO and Wolt’s Vice President of Security and\ntheir teams. Both programs have in place coordinated cybersecurity incident response processes that set forth\nprocedures for managing and responding to cybersecurity incidents across the enterprise, including the assignment\nof cross-functional roles and responsibilities and protocols for the escalation of significant incidents to members\nof management and our audit committee.\n52\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. When\nwe determine that we have meritorious defenses to any claims asserted, we defend ourselves vigorously; however we\nalso consider settlement of disputes when, in management’s judgment, it is in the best interests of both DoorDash\nand its shareholders to do so. For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of\nthe amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that\ncould potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal\nProceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded or non-monetary damages.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under California\nLabor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and\nother matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. Various other\nDashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our\nplatform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers,\nwith many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent\ncontractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nfiled an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified\nCalifornia Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and\nthe California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages\nand a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September\n2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded\n53\nTable of Contents\nits application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for\nProposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in\nNovember 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners consisting of a number\nof individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County Superior Court to compel the\nState of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as unconstitutional. In August 2021, after a\nmerits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is\nunenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual\nsponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California First District Court of Appeal. In March 2023, the Court\nof Appeal overturned the Alameda County Superior Court's ruling and upheld nearly all of Proposition 22 as state\nlaw. In April 2023, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a petition for review\nin the Supreme Court of California, which was granted in June 2023.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws, and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies\nconcerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models,\ncompliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’\ncompensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development\nDepartment of the State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD\nissued a negative assessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA\nEDD’s assessment, and intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is\nuncertain and, accordingly, we have recorded an accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. We are currently the subject of government\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries in other jurisdictions as well, and we may in the future settle, or\nrecord accruals with respect to, such matters. Further, the results of investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an\ninvestigation, audit, demand, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or\nunfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse\nimpact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n54\nTable of Contents"

The increase in Total Orders was driven\nprimarily by growth in consumers and increased consumer engagement as well as the inclusion of Wolt, which we\nacquired in the second quarter of 2022, for a full fiscal year.\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces,\nincluding taxes, tips 4 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and\nWolt+. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Business. Marketplace GOV does\nnot include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through\nDrive, Storefront, or Bbot.\nMarketplace GOV grew to $66.8 billion in 2023, a 25% increase compared to 2022, driven primarily by organic growth\nin Total Orders as well as the inclusion of Wolt for a full fiscal year.\nNet Revenue Margin. We define Net Revenue Margin as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV.\nNet Revenue Margin increased to 12.9% in 2023 from 12.3% in 2022 , primarily due to improved logistics efficiency\nand quality, as well as increasing contribution from advertising revenue.\nContribution Profit. We define Contribution Profit as our gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus (i)\ndepreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included\nin cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring. Gross\nprofit is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii)\ndepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is\na useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct\nexpenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nContribution Profit increased to $2.5 billion in 2023 from $1.6 billion in 2022 , driven primarily by growth in\nrevenue, partially offset by increases in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, as well as the\ninclusion of Wolt for a full fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests,\nadjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on\ndisposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition,\nintegration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory\nwrite-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income)\nexpense, net, (ix) other expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and\n(xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage\nin our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $1.2 billion in 2023 from $361 million in 2022, driven primarily by growth in\nContribution Profit, partially offset by the inclusion of Wolt operating expenses for a full fiscal year.\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nFree Cash Flow increased to $1.3 billion in 2023 from $21 million in 2022, driven primarily by an increase in net\ncash provided by operating activities.\n4 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n59\nTable of Contents\nResults of

Foreign\njurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our\nforeign earnings may also be taxable in the United States.\nAccordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes\nin our stock price, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit\ndevelopments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and\nlosses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\nrelated to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in\nvarious jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.\nAdditionally, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses varies depending on the amount of pre-tax\nincome or loss. For example, the impact of any particular item is greater when the amount of our pre-tax income or\nloss is smaller.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the United States and Finland. We expect to\nmaintain these valuation allowances until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax\nassets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the United States and Finland.\n(in millions,                    Year Ended\nexcept                         December 31,\npercentages)                           2021       2022       2023    2022 to 2023       $ Change    % Change\nProvision for\n(benefit from)        $                   5    $   -31    $    31                    $        62              *\nincome\ntaxes\n* Percentage not meaningful .\nIn 2023, the income tax expense of $31 million was primarily driven by U.S. pre-tax book income and resulting U.S.,\nand foreign cash tax liabilities. In 2022, a partial income tax benefit of $31 million was recognized for foreign\nlosses and the remaining income tax benefit was offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the valuation\nallowance, such income tax benefit is not expected to recur in the future.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 – \"Income Taxes\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense,\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our\nbusiness and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ninvestors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance\nand future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors\nin seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these\nnon-GAAP\n64\nTable of Contents\nfinancial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of our\nbusiness over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted\nresearch and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution\nMargin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be considered in\naddition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free\nCash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial\nmeasure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and\ndevelopment expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin,\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their\nrespective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to\nrestructuring. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as\nit is generally a fixed cost and is not directly impacted by Total Orders.

We believe it is appropriate to exclude the\nforegoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the timing and\nmagnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process,\nand (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be\nmaterial to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory\ncertainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\n(2) Consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs, primarily related to our acquisition of\nWolt.\n(3) Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former\nheadquarters.\n66\nTable of Contents\nContribution Profit\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests, adjusted\nto exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of\nproperty and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and\ninvestment related costs), (iv)\n67\nTable of Contents\nimpairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision\nfor (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income) expense, net, (ix) other expense, net, (x) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests to\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                                   2021         2022        2023\nNet loss including redeemable             $                     -468    $  -1,368    $   -565\nnon-controlling interests\nCertain legal, tax, and regulatory                                77           72         162\nsettlements, reserves, and expenses(1)\nTransaction-related costs(2)                                      10           68           2\nImpairment expenses(3)                                             1            2           —\nRestructuring charges                                              —           92           2\nInventory write-off related to                                     —            2           —\nrestructuring\nProvision for (benefit from) income                                5          -31          31\ntaxes\nInterest (income) expense, net                                    11          -30        -152\nOther expense, net(4)                                              —          305         107\nStock-based compensation expense and                             497          880       1,094\ncertain payroll tax expense(5)\nDepreciation and amortization expense                            156          369         509\nAdjusted EBITDA                           $                      289    $     361    $  1,190\n(1) We exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that\nthese costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do not reflect the underlying\neconomics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs and expenses consist\nof (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, as well as a settlement entered into\nin connection with an initiative to serve underrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and settlements or other\nresolutions for or related to the collection of sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do not expect to incur on\na recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement of an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related\nto supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification, other labor law matters,\nand price controls, and (v) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of\nAdjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of\nmanagement’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management\ncurrently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of\nincreasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California\nand similar legislation.\n(2) Consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs, primarily related to our acquisition of\nWolt.\n(3) Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former\nheadquarters.\n(4) Consists primarily of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment.\n(5) Excludes stock-based compensation related to restructuring, which is included in restructuring charges in the\ntable above.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and\ncapitalized software and website development costs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                                2021       2022        2023\nNet cash provided by operating         $                      692    $   367    $  1,673\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment                          -129       -176        -123\nCapitalized software and website                             -108       -170        -201\ndevelopment costs\nFree Cash Flow                         $                      455    $    21    $  1,349\nCredit Facilities\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an\naffiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, and further amended on October 31, 2022, provides for a\n$300 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on August 7, 2025, which increased to $400 million in\naggregate revolving commitments upon the consummation of our initial public offering, with a sublimit for the\nissuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to $200 million. Loans under the credit facility\nbear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the\nfederal funds rate or a composite overnight bank\n68\nTable of Contents\nborrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an\nadjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of one, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are\nalso obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit\nfees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the\ncovenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, no revolving loans\nwere outstanding and $99 million and $115 million of letters of credit were issued under our revolving credit\nfacility, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $4.7 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.4 billion and long-term marketable securities of $583 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $356 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable\nsecurities consisted of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $5.2\nbillion as of December 31, 2023. We have historically funded our operations from cash from operations as well as\nthe issuance of equity securities, including in our initial public offering in December 2020.To execute on our\nstrategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash\nflows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the available borrowings under our revolving\ncredit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the\nnext 12 months and beyond.\nIn February 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our Class A common\nstock. We completed the repurchase program in October 2023.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $1.1 billion. This program is in addition to the prior\nrepurchase program for the repurchase of $750 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was completed in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through\nprivately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant\nfactors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of\nthe Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our\nClass A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a\nvariety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment\nopportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                  2021       2022        2023\nNet cash provided by operating           $                      692    $   367    $  1,673\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                        -2,047       -300        -342\nNet cash used in financing activities                          -483       -375        -752\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                            -1        -10           5\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash    $                   -1,839    $  -318    $    584\nequivalents, and restricted cash\n69\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for 2023 . This primarily consisted of a net loss of $565\nmillion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes $1.1 billion of non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense, $509 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $101 million of impairments of non-\nmarketable equity securities, and reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease\nliabilities of $108 million, as well as $417 million net inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities\nprimarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for\n2023 compared to 2022 was mainly due to the decrease in net loss for 2023 .\nCash provided by operating activities was $367 million for 2022 . This consisted of a net loss of $1.4 billion,\nadjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes $889 million or non-cash stock-based compensation\nexpense, $369 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $303 million of adjustments to non-marketable\nequity securities, including impairment, net, and reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of\noperating lease liabilities of $81 million, as well as $73 million net inflows from changes in operating assets and\nliabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $342 million for 2023 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $1.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $123 million, cash outflows for capitalized\nsoftware and website development costs of $201 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $17\nmillion, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.9 billion.\nCash used in investing activities was $300 million for 2022 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $1.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $176 million, cash outflows for capitalized\nsoftware and website development costs of $170 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $15\nmillion, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.9 billion and net cash\nacquired in acquisitions of $71 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $752 million for 2023 , which consisted repurchases of our Class A common\nstock of $750 million and cash paid for other financing activities of $8 million, offset by proceeds from the\nexercise of stock options of $6 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $375 million for 2022 , which consisted of repurchases of our Class A common\nstock of $400 million, offset by cash received from other financing activities of $14 million and proceeds from the\nexercise of stock options of $11 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\n70\nTable of Contents\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which\nis recognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a\nratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of\nmembership purchased by the consumer. We also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees\nfrom merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated\nthrough their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control\nof the merchant’s products.\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local\ncommerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as we do not have the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor do we\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through our Marketplaces. The majority of gift cards sold have\nno expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited\nhistory as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded\nas contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed\nsufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to\nestimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no\nlegal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or\nabandoned property. We recognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue\nrecognition for the gift card redemptions. We recorded $48 million, $47 million, and $41 million of gift card\nbreakage revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Estimating future breakage\nrates requires judgment based on current and historical\n71\nTable of Contents\npatterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate. For jurisdictions where gift\ncards have expiration dates, we recognize breakage when they expire.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals : We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. We use assumptions based\non actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss development factors, which includes the development\ntime frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as\nnecessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our\nestimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate\n72\nTable of Contents\ncomponent of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investment policy and\nstrategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into\ninvestments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. However,\nwe believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $124 million and $46 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Adjustments or impairments are recorded in other expense, net on the\nconsolidated statements of operations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome (loss) from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international\nbusinesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Based on\nour foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, we estimated that a\n10% change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity.\n73\nTable of Contents"

We also have\naudited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n75\nTable of Contents\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which\ninclude retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was $ 758million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 20,

STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 – \"Revenue\" for revenue by geography. Long-lived assets, which consist\nof property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, located outside of the United States were $\n124million and $ 167million a s of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit\nlosses, gift card\n83\nTable of Contents\nbreakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development costs,\nintangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments\nincluding valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation of acquired intangible\nassets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance reserves, loss\ncontingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash\nconsists of bank accounts that are legally restricted for use, including collateral provided for letters of credit\nestablished primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, U.S. Treasury securities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of\nmarketable securities and limits the concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with\nmaturities greater than three months, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with\nmaturities greater than one year are included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All\nmarketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company\nevaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors considered in\ndetermining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost\nbasis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for\ncredit losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is limited\nby the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis. When a credit loss\nexists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with\nthe amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was recorded. Unrealized\nlosses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with\nmerchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\n84\nTable of Contents\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive and Marketplace related offerings. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on\nthe Company’s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the\nallowance for credit losses on a collective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each\ncustomer’s expected ability to pay and collection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts\nreceivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “ Impairment of Long-Lived A ssets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2023 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Nogoodwill impairment charge was\nrecorded in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative).\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs\n85\nTable of Contents\nincurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post implementation\noperational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform are capitalized when\npreliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project\nfunding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Costs\nincurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized and expensed over\nthe estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. The Company utilizes\nassumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss development factors, which\nincludes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically\nreviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate\nresults may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could result in losses over the Company’s reserved\namounts.During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company recorded additions to the insurance\nreserves of $ 134million, $ 359million and $ 518million, respectively. The Company’s retained insurance deductibles\nreserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $ 418million and $ 758million, respectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s\nforeign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into\nU.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n86\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant. With the exception of the CEO Performance Award and options assumed via acquisition (as\ndiscussed further in Note 10 - \"Common Stock\"), the Company only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a\nservice-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as discussed below in Note 10 - \"Common Stock\"), that includes a market condition,\nthe fair value of the award was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based\ncompensation is recorded over the derived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the stock\nprice goals are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based compensation\nexpense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be\nthe Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period, regardless of whether the stock price goals are achieved.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The\nCompany recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the\nenactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that\nit believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and\nnegative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future income,\nand other relevant factors. Our judgment regarding levels of future profitability are consistent with plans and\nestimates used to manage the business, however actual operating results in future years could differ from our\ncurrent assumptions, judgments and estimates. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which\nmay require periodic adjustments. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate\nsettlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefit may differ significantly from\nthe estimates. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n87\nTable of Contents\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in funds held at\npayment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to\nDashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-\nauthorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive and Marketplace related offerings.As of December 31, 2022, one entity in dividually accounted for 14% of\naccounts receivable, net. As of December 31, 2023, one entity in dividually accounted for 13% of accounts\nreceivable, net. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and\n2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through its Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of the Marketplaces . Revenue generated from the\nCompany’s DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\ncommerce platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local commerce platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the\n88\nTable of Contents\ndelivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further,\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the\npromises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than\nas a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through its Marketplaces. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. The majority of gift cards\nsold have no expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with\nlimited history as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and\nrecorded as contract liabilities until consumers used the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that it\nhad developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have\nthe ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for\nwhich there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as\nunclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the\npattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. The Company recorded $ 48million, $ 47million and $\n41million of gift card breakage revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\nEstimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the\nactual breakage rates may vary from the estimate. For jurisdictions where gift cards have expiration dates, the\nCompany recognizes breakage when they expire.\n89\nTable of Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local commerce platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below.\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 1.2billion, $ 1.1billion, and $ 1.3billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to DoorDash,\nInc. common stockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating\nsecurities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock, Class B common\nstock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A\ncommon stock and Class B\n90\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net losses. Noshares of Class C common stock were issued and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic\nnet loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not\nbeen settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from oneto six years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual\nvalue guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if it has a variable\ninterest in an entity and if it is the primary beneficiary. These evaluations are complex and involve judgment and\nthe use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other\nfactors. If the Company determines that entities for which the Company holds a contractual or ownership interest in\nare variable interest entities (\"VIE\") and that the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates\nsuch entities in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets\nboth of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either\ncase could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in the\ninterest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether the Company is still the primary\nbeneficiary. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the\ninvestment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 14 - Variable\nInterest Entities for further information.\n91\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nCosts and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are\nincurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless\nfuture service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Ongoing employee\ntermination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is\nreasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated\nstatements of operations and related liabilities are recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates\nbased on currently available information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. ASU\n2023-07 expands segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss,\nan amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable\nsegment’s profit or loss and assets. Additionally, the amendments require disclosure of the title and position of\nthe CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing\nsegment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required\nfor entities with a single reportable segment. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the update on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomprised of the Company's Marketplaces and Platform Services.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021        2022        2023\nUnited States    $                    4,877    $  6,251    $  7,781\nInternational                            11         332         854\nTotal revenue    $                    4,888    $  6,583    $  8,635\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nand merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over\ntime. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows\n(in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nBeginning balance                          $                           251\nAddition to contract liabilities                                     2,247\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                             -2,190\nEnding balance                             $                           308\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n92\nTable of Contents\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 129million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023. The ending\nbalance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.

Acquisitions\nWolt Acquisition\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of Wolt\nEnterprise Oy (“Wolt”). The Company's aim is to accelerate its product development, increase its international\nscale, bring greater focus to its markets outside the United States, and improve the value provided to consumers,\nmerchants, as well as Dashers around the world. The Company’s acquisition-related costs were $ 48million and all\ncosts were recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations\nduring the period in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for\nWolt was $ 2,838million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nDoorDash Class A common stock             $       2,705\nStock-based compensation awards\n(DoorDash options, RSUs, and revesting                   133\ncommon stock) attributable to\npre-combination services\nTotal consideration                       $       2,838\nThe fair value of 36million shares of Class A common stock issued was determined on the basis of the closing market\nprice of the Company’s Class A common stock on the acquisition date. The Company also issued certain stock-based\ncompensation awards and their fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\napplicable\n93\nTable of Contents\nassumptions as of the acquisition date for options ( 1.7million DoorDash options) and using the closing market\nprice of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date for RSUs ( 1.4million DoorDash RSUs).\nFor certain Wolt employees, a portion of their total consideration transferred was restricted subject to revesting\nover a service period, including 568thousand shares of the Company's Class A common stock. This restricted equity\nconsideration is considered compensation for post-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based\ncompensation expense over the next four years, based on the fair value of the shares using the closing market price\nof the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Wolt acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 1,997million of goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Wolt and anticipated synergies from the\nfuture growth and strategic advantages in the global local commerce industry. The goodwill recorded in connection\nwith the acquisition of Wolt is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, with the assistance of an independent third-party\nvaluation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMay 31, 2022\nCurrent assets                   $           272\nIntangible assets                            772\nGoodwill                                   1,997\nOther non-current assets                      82\nCurrent liabilities                         -204\nDeferred tax liability, net                  -34\nOther non-current liabilities                -47\nTotal purchase price             $         2,838\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful life as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       May 31, 2022\nMerchant relationships                            11    $           236\nTrademark                                         10                268\nExisting technology                                6                150\nCustomer relationships                             3                107\nCourier relationships                              1                 11\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $           772\nExisting technology represents the existing online and mobile Wolt platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and\npickup orders. The merchant, customer, and courier relationships represent the fair value of the underlying\nrelationships with merchants, such as restaurants and grocery stores, users of Wolt’s food and delivery services,\nand courier partners. The estimated fair values of the existing technology and trademarks were determined using a\nrelief from royalty method. The fair values of the merchant, courier and customer relationships were determined\nusing a replacement cost method. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a\nstraight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\nFrom the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022, the amount of revenue and net loss from Wolt included in\nthe consolidated statements of operations were $ 259million and $ 345million, respectively.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Wolt acquisition had\nbeen completed on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2021. The unaudited pro forma information\nis based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and primarily reflects adjustments\nfor the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets and\ntransaction costs. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not\nnecessarily indicative of what the\n94\nTable of Contents\nactual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred on January 1,\n2021, nor are they indicative of future results of operations. The unaudited pro forma results were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December\n31,                         2021         2022\nRevenue                            $   5,128    $   6,734\nNet loss                           $  -1,039    $  -1,549\nBbot Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired Bbot, a hospitality technology company. The addition of Bbot's products and\ntechnology to the Company's platform will offer merchants more solutions for their in-store and online channels,\nincluding in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of\naccounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $ 9million\nindemnification holdback, which was settled during the three month period ended June 30, 2023.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's best estimate and assumptions,\nwith the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMarch 1, 2022\nCurrent assets          $             11\nIntangible assets                     18\nGoodwill                              60\nOther liabilities                     -1\nTotal purchase price    $             88\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology and customer relationships, which had estimated\nremaining useful lives of 5and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n5.

The fair value of the Company’s Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from\nindependent pricing services, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments in less\nactive markets or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities of $ 409million, $ 18million and $ 23million, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices,\nthe classification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with consumer protection\nlaws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. For example, the Company is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of\nCalifornia (the “CA EDD”) for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain\namounts that it found to be owed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent\ncontractors. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse\nassessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is uncertain and, accordingly, the Company has recorded\nan accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets\nas of December 31, 2023. The results of investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries and related governmental\naction are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, demand, or\ninquiry having a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to the Company's technology. The terms of\nthese indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement.\n101\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers of the Company, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct\nof the individual.\nThe maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements. Noliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of data processing,\nSoftware as a Service, and technology platform infrastructure. These purchase commitments are not recorded as\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 as the Company has not yet received the\nrelated services. As of December 31, 2023, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-cancelable purchase\ncommitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2024                                   214\n2025                                   238\n2026                                   202\n2027                                   187\n2028                                    77\nTotal future minimum payments    $     918\nInsurance Collateral\nThe Company is required to maintain $ 465million in collateral in connection with certain insurance policies, which\ncan be held in a combination of cash, surety bonds, and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\n$ 465million of collateral outstanding in the form of surety bonds and letters of credit in connection with the\ninsurance collateral requirement.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provided for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. In August 2020, the Company amended\nand restated the revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide for $ 100million of incremental revolving loan\ncommitments, effective upon consummation of the Company's initial public offering (the \"IPO\"), for total revolving\ncommitments of $ 400million. The amendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit\nfacility from November 19, 2024 to August 7, 2025. As further amended on October 31, 2022, loans under the credit\nfacility bear interest at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nSOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of\none, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees\nfor a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused\ncommitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement\nreporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as customary negative covenants that\nrestrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur\nliens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, merge or consolidate with other companies or\nsell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and acquisitions, and engage in transactions with\naffiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2022 and 2023, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nIn addition to the letters of credit maintained in connection with the insurance collateral requirement, the\nCompany also maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company had $ 132million and $ 138million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 99million and $ 115million, respectively, were issued from the revolving credit and\nguaranty agreement.\n102\nTable of Contents\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state, local and foreign tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect\ntax matters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves as they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the\namounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from the\namounts accrued.\n10. Common Stock\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2023, the Company authorized the repurchase of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $\n750million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 12.0million shares of its Class A\ncommon stock at a weighted average price of $ 62.66per share for a total amount of $ 750million. The shares were\nretired immediately upon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company has granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the Wolt acquisition.\nVesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment at the Company during the\nrequisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance date. The fair value of the\nrestricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is recorded as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of                    Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares                 Grant Date\n31, 2022                                          472       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                             —    $                     —\nVested                                           -186    $                 76.91\nForfeited                                          -1    $                 76.91\nUnvested restricted stock as of December          285\n31, 2023\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nStock options issued and outstanding       December 31, 2022    December 31, 2023\nunder the 2014 Plan and Inducement Plan               16,021                9,022\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 Plan,                 45,131               37,822\n2020 Plan and Inducement Plan\nRemaining shares available for future                 39,995               50,137\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                107,646              103,480\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10%\n103\nTable of Contents\nstockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options\ngranted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of\nshares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014\nPlan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to\nthe terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO registration statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the\nCompany's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are\nforfeited, canceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on\nJanuary 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total\nnumber of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each\nautomatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to\nthe applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\n2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “Inducement\nPlan”), pursuant to which the Company reserved 9,760,000shares of Class A common stock to be used exclusively for\ngrants of equity-based awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, as a\nmaterial inducement to the individual’s entry into employment with the Company. The Inducement Plan permits the\ngrant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and\nperformance shares. Shares that actually have been issued under the Inducement Plan under any award will not be\nreturned to the Inducement Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Inducement Plan;\nhowever, if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares or performance units are\nrepurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such shares will become\navailable for future grant under the Inducement Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to\nsatisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under\nthe Inducement Plan. The exercise price, term, and any other terms and conditions of the options granted under the\nInducement Plan will be determined by the administrator of the plan.\nRSUs\nThe Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition, which is\ngenerally four years. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period.\n104\nTable of Contents\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $ 112million, $ 112million, and $ 104million of stock-based compensation expense related to\nthe CEO Performance Award during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. As of December\n31, 2023, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 73million.\n105\nTable of Contents\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 Plan, 2020 Plan, and Inducement Plan was as follows (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2022                     16,021    $       2.84                 3.48    $        737\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                           -6,999    $       0.87                         $        510\nCancelled and forfeited                                  —    $          —\nBalance as of December 31, 2023                      9,022    $       4.38                 3.41    $        853\nExercisable as of December 31, 2023                  8,747    $       4.39                 3.43    $        827\nVested and expected to vest as of                    9,022    $       4.38                 3.41    $        853\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the securities exchange on\nwhich such shares were listed as of the respective year-end dates.

Key assumptions of the Black-Scholes valuation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected\nvolatility, expected term and expected dividends. The Company determined the expected term of assumed in the money\noption awards considering vesting provisions, the expected exercise behavior, and contractual term of the awards.\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration\nto the expected term of the stock option awards. The Company developed the expected volatility using the average\nvolatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of similar publicly traded peer companies.\nThe Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on its common\nstock.\nThere were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, except for the\noptions assumed via acquisition in 2022.

A\ntotal of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each\nfiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any)\noccurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of\nthe outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or\n(iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such\nperiod will begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n11.

Overall, the\nvaluation allowance increased by $ 1.0billion, $ 257million, and $ 203million in the years ended December 31, 2021,\n2022, and 2023, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1.7billion and $ 1.2billion, respectively. Federal net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. Of the $\n1.2billion of state net operating losses, $ 191million is carried forward indefinitely. The remaining state net\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had foreign net\noperating loss carryforwards of $ 1.3billion that begin to expire in 2025.\nThe Company also had $ 278million and $ 146million of federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The federal research and development tax credits expire in\nvarying amounts starting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward\nindefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a\ncurrent limitation on the tax attributes under Section 382 and 383.\nThe Company intends to invest substantially all of its foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as its capital in its\nforeign subsidiaries, indefinitely in those jurisdictions in which the Company could incur significant, additional\ncosts upon repatriation of such amounts.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021       2022       2023\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        7    $    69    $    69\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                               62         19         47\npositions\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                  —          —         67\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                  —        -19          —\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                       69    $    69    $   183\nThe Company had $ 183million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023, the majority of which\nwould not impact its effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does\nnot anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at December 31, 2023\nwill significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, which were immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which the Company operates include the United States and Finland. The Company’s 2013 and\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s 2017 and\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination in Finland.\n12. Net Loss per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders using the two-class\nmethod required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than\nvoting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net\nlosses.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to DoorDash,\nInc. common stockholders during the periods presented.

Employee Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. In 2023, the Company began to make\ndiscretionary matching contributions to those participating employees who met certain employment criteria. The\nCompany's matching contributions to the plan was not material for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEmployees based in Finland are covered under the Finnish Employees’ Pension Act (“TyEL”). TyEL is a statutory\nprivate sector pension act that is partly funded and paid through a pay-as-you-go pool. The Old-age Pension and\nDisability Pension benefits of TyEL are classified as postretirement benefits under defined benefit plan accounting\nstandards and based on an actuarial valuation. The Old-age Pension liability for active employees includes the\neffect of future salary increases. The Disability Pension liability for active employees is based on employees'\ntotal salary two years before the fiscal year.\nNet periodic benefit cost is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Service cost is\nreflected in total costs and expenses. Other components of net periodic benefit cost, including interest cost and\namortization of actuarial gains and losses, is included in other (expense) income, net. Actuarial gains and losses\nresulting from remeasurement are initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n14. Variable Interest Entities\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company formed a joint venture with a retail partner in Canada with the objective of providing\non-demand delivery of grocery and convenience items to customers in Canada (the \"JV\"). The Company owns a majority\ninterest in the JV.\nIn connection with the formation of the JV, the Company had committed to contribute cash and certain assets worth $\n98million Canadian dollars (approximately $ 75million US dollars) over three years. Upon the closing of the\ntransaction,\n108\nTable of Contents\nthe Company contributed cash and certain assets of $ 41million Canadian dollars (approximately $ 32million US\ndollars). Additional capital contributions will be made in a manner that preserves the ownership percentage of each\nshareholder.\nThe common units held by the Company in the JV were determined to be a variable interest. The Company is the\nprimary beneficiary because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\nperformance of the JV. As a result, the Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the JV.\nTotal assets of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $ 68million\nand $ 39million, respectively. Total liabilities of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023 were $ 17million and $ 11million, respectively.\nThe JV’s assets may only be used to settle the JV’s obligations and may not be used for other consolidated\nentities. The JV’s liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of the Company’s other consolidated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the minority shareholder’s ownership in the JV is classified as redeemable non-\ncontrolling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the Company’s control. The\nredeemable non-controlling interest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that\nthe non-controlling interest will become redeemable. Total redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 14million and\n$ 7million as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling\ninterest was $ 3million and $ 7million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\n15. Restructuring\nOn November 30, 2022, the Company committed to a reduction in workforce (the “Plan”) intended to better align the\nCompany’s talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Plan included the\nelimination of approximately 1,250positions across the Company, or approximately 7% of the Company’s current\nemployee workforce at such time.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an additional $ 2million in connection with the\nPlan, primarily consisting of separation-related payments and other termination benefit costs. These expenses are\nincluded in restructuring charges in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made cash payments amounting to $ 50million in connection with\nthe Plan. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining liabilities related to the plan were immaterial.\n16. Subsequent Events\nIn February 2024, the Company announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of\nshares of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $ 1.1billion. Repurchases may be made from time to\ntime through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions,\napplicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in\naccordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Company may also, from time to time, enter\ninto Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock under this authorization. The timing\nand actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and\nmarket conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\n109\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\n(“certifying officers”), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our board\nof directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n110\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to do this by providing services that reduce friction in\nlocal commerce and help merchants better connect with consumers in their communities. Our primary offerings include\nthe DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), and our Commerce Platform.\nOur Marketplaces operate in over 30 countries, including the United States, and account for the vast majority of\nour revenue today. Our Marketplaces serve three primary constituents: merchants, consumers, and the independent\ncontractors who use our platform to generate earnings, or \"Dashers 1 .\"\nOur Marketplaces provide an integrated suite of services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect\nwith consumers in their communities, and solve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand\ngeneration, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We typically earn a fee\nfrom merchants for the services we provide based on the size of each transaction. We also offer advertising as a\nvalue-added service through our Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies increase\nconsumer engagement and drive incremental revenue.\nConsumers access our Marketplaces through our apps and websites to discover, engage with, and purchase goods from\nmerchants in their communities. We seek to attract and retain consumers based primarily on the selection,\nconvenience, quality, affordability, and service we provide. We typically charge consumers fees for each\ntransaction, inclusive of a fixed delivery fee and a service fee that varies based on the size of the transaction.\nOur Marketplaces also offer our consumer membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to lower transactional\nfriction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge, while providing additional membership benefits. In\nDecember 2024, our Marketplaces served over 42 million monthly active users 2 and, as of December 31, 2024, we had\nover 22 million DashPass and Wolt+ members.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer our Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help merchants\ngrow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive (together,\n\"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within our Commerce\nPlatform. In addition to Drive, we also provide services within our Commerce Platform that help merchants establish\nonline ordering, build branded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support.\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Drive provide opportunities to generate income that helps them achieve their\ngoals. Dashers choose if, when, and where to dash, which tasks to accept, as well as how frequently and for how\nlong to dash each time they choose to do so. We typically pay Dashers based on the amount of time they are active\non our platform or the number of tasks they complete and the time, distance, and desirability associated with each\ntask. We seek to attract Dashers primarily based on the accessibility, flexibility, and earnings opportunities we\nprovide.\nWe believe our business achieves its greatest benefits when we provide attractive services for each of our key\nconstituents. Consequently, to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with an expanding suite of\nservices that help them build and grow successful omnichannel businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives\nincreased adoption; and Dashers with unique opportunities that compete effectively for their time and effort with\nevery task.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services.\n1 Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt\ncourier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2024.\n6\nTable of Contents\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and\nproducts available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, overall quality of the dashing\nexperience, and earnings potential.\nIn particular, local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and\nintensely competitive. Globally, we compete with other local on-demand delivery companies, including Uber Eats,\nJust Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and other local incumbents. We also compete with merchants that have their own\nonline ordering platforms, online ordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets,\ngrocers and grocery delivery services, convenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies\nthat provide merchant delivery services. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such\nas take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers. As we continue to expand\ninto additional verticals, we may compete or come in closer competition with additional businesses with substantial\nresources, users, and brand power.\nFor additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “ Risk\nFactors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete\neffectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. ”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had over 23,700 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants.\nCertain international employees are subject to statutory collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced\nany work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2024, 8 million people dashed 3 , earning a total of over $18 billion.\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incrementally in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors, we\nmust compete for their time and effort with every task. We compete against other earnings opportunities, other\nsources of capital like loans or credit cards, as well as alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure.\nBecause of this competition, we must make dashing attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices\navailable. Specifically, we strive to make dashing positive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers to entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law,\nprospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car.\nPeople who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We\nknow of no other earnings opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earnings needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs,\nschool, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\n3 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in 2024.\n7\nTable of Contents\nEarnings : We must provide Dashers with opportunities to earn that are competitive with alternative opportunities\nand commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of earnings, we provide tools that\nimprove immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by Dashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ngeographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and\nretain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we\namplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the\ntools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2024, we had 244 issued U.S. patents, 25 patents issued in non-U.S. jurisdictions, 54 U.S. patent applications\npending, and 21 patent applications pending in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We continually review our development\nefforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2024, we held 56 registered trademarks in the United States and\n194 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered\ndomain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation ” and “ Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperation s.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions.\nThese laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment,\ncommissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality\nobligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, membership services,\nintellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, advertising, taxation, privacy, data\nprotection, cybersecurity, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action\nwaiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and\nbackground checks.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\nall or part of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (our \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n10\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services, expanded\ninto new categories, changed our pricing methodologies, and entered new geographies. This limited operating history\nand our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may\nencounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nwith respect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline and food costs;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations;\neffectively adapt to and manage the regulatory environment and new laws related to our business; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have relatively limited\nhistorical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of\noperations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more\npredictable market. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations\ncould differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nWhile we achieved net income in the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred net losses in each preceding year\nsince our founding. We incurred a net loss of $558 million and achieved net income of $123 million in 2023 and\n2024, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $5.2 billion and $5.3\nbillion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase over time and we expect to invest significant additional\nfunds towards growing our business. To the extent that we are unable to earn sufficient revenue to offset such\ncosts, we may incur losses in certain future periods. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial\nfinancial and other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or\nacquiring new platform features and services, acquiring and integrating technologies and businesses, expanding into\nnew markets and categories, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than\nwe expect and may not result in sufficient increased revenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any\nfailure to increase our revenue\n11\nTable of Contents\nsufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from consistently achieving,\nmaintaining, or increasing profitability on a consistent basis, which could also negatively impact our cash flow.\nIf we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.6\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nOur business has grown rapidly during various periods since our founding. Our past revenue growth rate, growth in\ndemand for our offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future\nperformance. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period\nas any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future\nperiods.\nIn particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the\nshort term and decline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market\nadoption. We may also experience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, or\nincreasing regulatory costs. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our\nbusiness, which may not result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our\nrevenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common\nstock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and\nother local incumbents. We also compete with merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide merchant delivery services.\nIn addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and\npaper menus that merchants distribute to consumers. As we continue to expand to additional verticals, we may\ncompete or come in closer competition with additional businesses with substantial resources, users, and brand\npower, including large e-commerce companies, large retailers, large grocery store chains and other large delivery\nservice providers.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, market-specific knowledge, established relationships with local merchants and suppliers,\nlarger existing user bases, more successful marketing capabilities, established geographic footprints and\ninfrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. For example, with\ngrocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains that have strong bargaining power, established\nrelationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater financial resources and product development\ncapabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies\nand changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive or obsolete.\nIf certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose\nto engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack\naccess to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our\ncompetitors have in the past, and may in the future, also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other\nstrategic relationships among themselves or with others, including by integrating their services or membership\nproducts with the offerings of another company that provides expanded distribution. Our competitors could also\nintroduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive\nmarketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose consumers or access to new consumers or require us\nto increase our marketing or promotional expenses or otherwise increase investment in our service in order to\nmaintain our position with existing and new consumers.\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and may offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for merchants joining their platforms and independent contractors who provide\ndelivery\n12\nTable of Contents\nservices, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of\nwhich may be more attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures have led us, and may lead us in\nthe future, to change our commission rates and fees or change our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain\ncompetitive. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will likely continue to negatively affect, our financial\nperformance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we\ncompete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of\nour competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive\nadvantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the\nincentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local on-demand delivery\nservices for food and the other areas in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will\nstabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants\ncould determine that it is in their best interests to develop their own platforms to offer online pickup and\ndelivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift based on\ncost, quality, and selection and could use more than one local commerce platform; independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings; and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain\nof our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than\nours, which would make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate.\nAs a result of the reasons described above, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing\nmerchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers,\nor are forced to reduce our commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to cost-effectively grow our\nplatform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new\nmarkets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts\nmore merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has grown in\nthe past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to incur\nsubstantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to\nacquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may\ninvest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for\nseveral years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will\nultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least 7 or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any exclusivity.\nIn the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection available on our\nlocal commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our relationships with some of\nour constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other constituencies. For example, the\nincreased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how compelling these offerings are to\nconsumers, depends in part on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership products. Additionally,\nmany of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and\nother reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby\nencouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our membership products, through prompts\nand notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other offerings.\n13\nTable of Contents\nHowever, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our platform\nafter they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our consumers\nto regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform, demand for our\nfull-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or\ndecline.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the\nability to decline offers or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity\nprovisions with Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with accessibility to and\nflexibility on our platform and compelling opportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers, retain\nexisting Dashers, or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or\nwork stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. Relatedly, if merchants and/or consumers\nchoose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the\nperceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we regularly invest in removing friction from the dashing process, offer monetary incentives and\nperquisites, including access to programs that provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, and provide\nopportunities to quickly access Dasher earnings. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing\nDashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase\nthe use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have unintended adverse consequences, including negative\npress, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation in both the\nUnited States and other geographies. Changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and\nemployment laws, or laws that require us to make changes to our platform that decrease the accessibility, including\nremoving access to our platform, or flexibility provided to Dashers in certain jurisdictions, may result in a\ndecrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of\nrecruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize\nour platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. If we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on\nfavorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, we may not be able to meet\nthe demands of merchants and consumers and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods, meeting our requirements and\nstandards, or price their goods on our platform at unreasonable rates, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nAn increase in merchant operating costs, whether due to inflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our\nplatform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect\nour revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. Further, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n14\nTable of Contents\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nthe mix among various aspects of our business, including our Marketplaces and Commerce Platform, our U.S. and\nnon-U.S. operations, our restaurant and non-restaurant categories, and contributions to our overall business by new\nproducts and services, such as our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and our advertising products;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe impact of weather and seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college\ncampuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform, regulations governing the rates that we pay Dashers that\nutilize our platform and other conditions of their work, and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge\nto merchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease and the response of governments and private industry;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become\nincreasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of\nour platform, especially during peak usage times, as our\n15\nTable of Contents\noperations grow and the usage of our platform increases. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not\nbe sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems\nfailures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions that\ninterrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These events have\nresulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of revenue and may\nharm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our\nplatform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders\nthat are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar\ncredits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and such\nclaims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, we may not be\nable to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. We have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to\nevaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent markets and there is no assurance that such acquired\nbusinesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we enter into, will be successfully integrated into our\nbusiness, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies and operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts,\nand personnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating internal controls, procedures, and policies and accounting, finance, and forecasting\npractices of acquired businesses with our own, especially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with non-U.S. jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition or other\naccounting practices, or employee or user issues;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change, or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operations, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or\nif the transaction costs are greater than expected.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. Strategic investments\ninherently involve less control over business operations of the investee, thereby potentially increasing the\nfinancial, legal, operational, regulatory, or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic\ninvestment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or\nentities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or\ncompetitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders,\nmanagement, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result\nin litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to\nsell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and\nregulations. Entry into certain transactions with non-U.S. entities now or in the future may be subject to\ngovernment regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or non-U.S. government\nentities. If a transaction with a non-U.S. entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might\nlimit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term\nbusiness strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments will generate returns for our\nbusiness, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, during the quarters\nended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, we recorded impairments of $312 million and $101 million,\nrespectively, associated with non-marketable equity securities that we acquired in connection with strategic\ninvestments.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets,\narrangements, and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\ncountries as part of our growth strategy. We currently operate in over 30 countries across the globe. Our\noperations outside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to\noversee operations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition\nto placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our\ninternational operations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. jurisdictions subject us to a number of risks and\nwe may not be successful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in non-U.S. countries and maintaining our\ncompany culture across all of our offices;\nan inability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers or an inability to reach agreements with and\nretain third party service providers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local area and culture, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n17\nTable of Contents\ndiffering demand dynamics and difficulty accurately predicting consumer preferences and purchasing habits, which\nmay make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, consumers, and Dashers in non-U.S.\njurisdictions;\ndifficulty complying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to\nlabor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment\nprocessing, transactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax laws, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions and cultural norms in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\nforeign currency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, which have occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations and differences in available instruments to invest our funds, including the risk profile associated\nwith such investments, and limitations on our ability to repatriate funds.\nChallenges with operating and growing our business internationally increase the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions, such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the\noperations of our wholly owned subsidiary, Wolt Enterprises Oy (\"Wolt\"), in jurisdictions that are in close\nproximity to Russia increase the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to\nbusiness with Russia.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors, and we may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, some jurisdictions in which we operate\nhave introduced price control measures on local commerce platforms and established minimum earnings standards for\ncertain delivery workers, including Dashers, and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These\nprice control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar regulations have caused, and may in the future\ncause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers.\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There is no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to\n18\nTable of Contents\nreduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform,\nfurther reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and\nmay in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher or consumer loyalty programs,\nsuch as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in\nwhich fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower commissions or fees, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our consumers’ price\nsensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and pricing methodologies may not\nbe competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion may require us to change our\noperations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing\nand gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, as the products\nand services on our platform change, we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers have previously led, and may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits,\narbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under a former pay model for Dashers in the United\nStates, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip.\nAlthough this additional pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also\nhad the effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being received by\nDashers. Government authorities have brought claims against us related to a former Dasher pay model and government\nauthorities may bring similar claims in the future against our pay models.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structures for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity or damage to our reputation. Changes to our pay models have resulted in, and in the future may\nresult in, negative publicity related to perceptions of its complexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and\nlack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, any of which may negatively impact our ability to attract\nand retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, we increased the amount we paid to Dashers per order\nwhen we changed our pay model in September 2019, but this also caused less consistency in earnings across\ndeliveries in some cases. In addition, in June 2023, we announced an option for Dashers in most cities to earn a\nguaranteed hourly rate while delivering. We change our Dasher pay models from time to time based on a variety of\nfactors, including as a result of legal and regulatory changes and expansion into new categories and geographies.\nIn particular, new or amended laws and regulations have required, and could in the future require, us to make\nchanges to our Dasher pay models, or make other changes to our platform, that decrease the flexibility provided to\nDashers in certain jurisdictions, which may also impact our ability to cost-effectively attract or retain Dashers.\nOur current Dasher pay models, any changes made in response to new laws and regulations, and any future changes to\nour pay models or our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the\nfees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform remain independent contractors, there is a risk\nthat Dashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or the laws of other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been involved in and\ncontinue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States. A\nreclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and Dasher pay models\nto account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other internal adjustments to account for any\ntransition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions, which could have an adverse effect that is material to\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. This growth has\nplaced, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nWe will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure, including the development of\nappropriate controls, in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nSimilarly, our failure to implement and maintain effective cybersecurity systems and measures with respect to our\nplatform as we grow could result in, among other things, breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service\ndisruptions, loss of user confidence in our platform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our\nreputation or brand, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand could hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform. Similarly, maintaining and\nenhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be particularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia.\nSuccessfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network\neffects of our platform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent,\nhigh-quality services and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use\nthe “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of\nother factors, many of which are outside our control. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of\ngoods, including other local commerce platforms and services, and consumer preferences may also change. To expand\nour user base, we must appeal to new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or\nother local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be adversely affected\nby complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize our platform or\nour competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect of negative\npublicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are disseminated\nvia social media platforms. Any such expressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to\nbe unfounded or successfully resolved without direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand,\nreputation, and local network effects. Negative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our business model, our platform, services or items provided through\nour platform, including highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines,\nincluding Dasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee courier or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, in which constituencies of our network become infected;\n20\nTable of Contents\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient number of offers or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or security\nbreaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact the\nreliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or operations;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, or inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of merchant, consumer, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nperception of any key brands, influencers, or other third parties that we have partnered with or may partner with\nin the future;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nFor example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers were\ncompensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food safety\nand quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform, which has\nadversely affected our reputation and brand from time to time. If we do not successfully develop, protect, and\nenhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network effects of our platform, our business may not grow,\nand we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, subject us\nto claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our reputation, brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and\nproprietary data relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our\nemployees. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external\nactors or with our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an\nexternal party or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current\ngeopolitical environment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors or state-\naffiliated actors. In addition to other vectors, cybersecurity incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems,\nwhich can be leveraged to access our websites, platforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors\nhave previously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported\nan incident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers\nand Dashers. We have undertaken steps to enhance our cybersecurity and\n21\nTable of Contents\ngovernance program, which include adding security layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional\npersonnel with cybersecurity experience, and using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot\nassure you that all potential causes of these incidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to\nrecurrence or other incidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or exfiltrate data from information systems\nchange frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable\nto anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate detective or preventive\nmeasures, and we and our vendors may face delays in our response to or remediation of breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means. In addition, there have been, and may in the future be additional, attempts to\nfraudulently induce our employees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names,\npasswords, payment card information, or other sensitive information resulting in user account takeovers or the\nfraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the prevalence of remote work, we may also be exposed to increased\nrisks of breaches or incidents via these or other methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to monitor and protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures\nhave not fully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and\ninfrastructure may be vulnerable to viruses, phishing and other forms of social engineering, denial-of-service,\ncredential stuffing, ransomware and other malware, insecure third-party libraries, application or network\nvulnerabilities, reliance on third-party vendors for patches, unauthorized configurations, employee error and\nmalfeasance, and other sources of disruption or unauthorized access, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may be\nable to access our systems and data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data, through our\nsystems. Although we have policies and technical controls restricting the access to and sharing of the data we\nstore, as well as requiring encryption of data where appropriate, these policies and controls may not be effective\nin all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our reputation,\nbrand, and competitive position, result in our platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to, or\nunavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant\nlegal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such actual or perceived breaches or incidents or any perception\nthat our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or\ndecreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at, or\nsuffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence\nin us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures and respond to any incidents impacting them is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant\nsupply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they\ndo not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other\ndisruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance that may help provide\ncoverage for these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will\nbe adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any\nfuture claim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or\nchanges in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIf the on-demand local commerce category does not continue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is uncertain\nto what extent the market for local commerce platforms will continue to grow. The markets for certain services we\nfacilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories, are in earlier stages of\ndevelopment than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for these services will continue to\ngrow and achieve stable, widespread market acceptance. In addition, through our acquisition of Wolt, we have\nentered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce category is in different stages of\nmarket acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt on-\ndemand local commerce platforms. If merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local\ncommerce platforms as we expect, including\n22\nTable of Contents\nas a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on\nour platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopt alternative solutions that may arise,\nthen the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop slower than we expect, either of which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nconsumer experience, which may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield results that conflict with\nthe market’s expectations, which could result in our stock price being adversely affected.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nconsumer experience, which we believe will ultimately drive long-term shareholder value. However, expanding our\nplatform and continually enhancing the consumer experience requires steady and significant investments, which may\nnot necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may negatively\nimpact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve\nthe consumer experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions\nmay not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term\nbenefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third party\nservice providers, whether or not occurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely\naffect our business, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third party\nservice providers, including the activities of former consumers and Dashers or individuals who are impersonating\nconsumers, merchants, Dashers, or other third party service providers, have occurred, and in the future may occur,\nwhich could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, dangerous or unlawful\nvehicular operation, assault, battery, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts,\nregistering consumer, merchant, or Dasher accounts with us using stolen personal information or altered\nidentification documents, additional forms of identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities have resulted\nin, and may in the future result in, physical injury, loss of life, property and financial damage for consumers,\nmerchants, Dashers, and other third parties, business disruption, reputational and brand damage, or other\nsignificant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card, debit card, or bank account information, fraud with respect to background checks,\nfraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, exploitation of system bugs or\nvulnerabilities to circumvent payment requirements, account takeovers of merchant, consumer, or Dasher accounts by\nbad actors, other unauthorized uses of another person's identity, and use of fraudulent identification documents.\nFor example, bad actors have created consumer, merchant, and Dasher accounts using stolen personal identifying\ninformation for illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s in the United States, and the\nequivalent in other countries with similar reporting obligations, to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not\nperforming services as Dashers. In addition, under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders\nfacilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved\nthe credit card transaction.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, Dashers, and other third party\nservice providers, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring or scale\nefficiently with our business and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through litigation or\nregulatory action, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to\nguard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all\nDashers undergo a background check where permitted by applicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent\nDashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable to implement and\ncommunicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors\ndo not adopt similar measures, the growth of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform\ncould be adversely affected. Any negative publicity related to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activities, or the measures we adopt to mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incidents\noccurred on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or\npublic perception of our industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and\npotentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. In\naddition, measures have been enacted in many U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local\ncommerce platforms like ours from facilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent.\nWe have adopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for\ndelivery on our platform in the United States and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nus. However, we may continue to add non-partner merchants in categories other than restaurants. We may also\ncontinue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the\nextent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this may adversely affect our\nability to provide a broad selection of merchants on our platform, attract and retain consumers and could directly\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, we do\nnot successfully manage our platform strategy, or we are not able to keep pace with technological developments, we\nmay not remain competitive and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. To compete\neffectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable merchant and consumer experience on our\nplatform, and we may be unable to effectively address merchant and consumer needs or identify emerging consumer\ntrends.\nIn addition, any new products or services that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective\nmanner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate\nsufficient revenue. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers may delay adoption and use of new products and services to\npermit them to make a more thorough evaluation of those products and services and to compare them against\npotentially competitive products in the market. Further, we may make changes to our platform and platform strategy\nthat merchants, consumers, or Dashers do not find useful and we may discontinue certain products, services, or\nfeatures that our merchants, consumers, or Dashers have otherwise enjoyed. To the extent that discontinued\nproducts, services, or features remain subject to a current contract with the applicable third party, we may incur\ncosts with respect to our determination to discontinue those products, services, or features. Failure to\neffectively manage our platform and platform strategy could lead to merchant, consumer, or Dasher dissatisfaction\nand contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If existing and new\nmerchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to be\nreliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform, we\nmay not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, if competitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices or consumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may\nbecome less popular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone\ndelivery technologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or\ndrone delivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our\npartners’ technology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend in\nlarge part on our ability to invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry\nstandards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our\n24\nTable of Contents\npersonnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not generate return on\ninvestment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If\nwe face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if our recently introduced\nofferings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform may forgo the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses,\nincluding DashMart and Wolt Market. To build and expand our self-operated businesses, we have made substantial\ninvestments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for in-store products, establishing\nsupply-related contractual partnerships, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies\nand processes. We plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of our\nself-operated businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will realize any of\nthe anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able to generate a\nsufficient number of orders to cover our fixed costs and make such services viable and we may incur significant\ncosts before we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-operated retail\nlocations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and Commerce\nPlatform, in particular with respect to food safety, permit and license requirements, and zoning restrictions, and\ncertain other business risks, including inventory shrinkage. Our expansion into convenience, grocery, and other\nretail categories, may also result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business opportunities as\nwell as the diversion of resources from support functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business, and attracting merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and we may not generate a meaningful return on these\ninitiatives. Even if we increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the\nadditional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not successful or\ncost-effective, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the gains in efficiency\nto our platform that we expect. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number\nof risks, including changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost-\neffectiveness of our platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do\nnot reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are\nunable to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency,\nDasher pay, and defective orders, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party customer support\nproviders who are qualified to support users of our platform and well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our\n25\nTable of Contents\ninternational business and the number of users not based in the U.S. on our platform, our support organization will\nface additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English and\nin ways consistent with the customs and dominant technologies used in the various geographies in which we operate.\nAny failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support,\ncould harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to scale our platform and business, our financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the\ncalendar year, although our rapid growth in historical periods has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder or more\ninclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand. In\ncontrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather when we need\nmore Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we typically rely\non incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs.\nFurther, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it impossible to fulfill\ndeliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we\nexperience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation\nperiods, causing adverse effects to our business during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause\nfluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the\nexisting seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in\nour results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our\nresults of operations and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges to economic conditions can impact consumer spending in the regions where we do business, which can prompt\nconsumers to reduce spending on our platform or forgo spending on our platform altogether. Any factor that impacts\nconsumer spending broadly may also impact consumer spending on our platform. Some of these factors include\nunemployment, inflation, consumer debt, fluctuations in transportation costs, increased food costs, declines in\nasset prices, mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, changes in interest rates and credit availability, and\nconsumer confidence in the current and future political and economic environment. Economic conditions in certain\nregions may also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters and threats to public health. Additionally,\nvolatility in the global financial markets, or in specific segments of those markets, may contribute to banks and\nfinancial institutions with whom we have banking or payment processing relationships entering receivership or\nbecoming insolvent in the future, and we may be unable to access or may lose some or all of our existing cash and\ncash equivalents to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or other insurance programs. Such volatility may also adversely impact any funds held temporarily at\nour third-party payment processors.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our\nCommerce Platform. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact\nconsumer demand and drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Commerce Platform. Small businesses\nthat do not have substantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely\naffected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small\nbusiness merchants, cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business\ndisruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely\nto use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse global economic and\npolitical conditions, including the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Both these conflicts have had, and\nmay continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in their respective regions and given rise to\nvolatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and Dashers on\nour platform in those regions.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in non-U.S. countries. When\nconducting business in non-U.S. countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country, which exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is currently to the Euro,\nthe Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, and the Australian dollar. Additionally, because our financial statements\nare presented in U.S. dollars, local functional currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable\nexchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements, thereby increasing our foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity, which\nmay reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and\nequity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train,\nand integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\n27\nTable of Contents\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\"). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, and any failure to do so could impact our ability to meet our\nfinancial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it\n28\nTable of Contents\ndoes not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an excessive number of users\naccessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return to our platform as often\nin the future, or at all. This could adversely affect our ability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ndecrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and network architecture to\naccommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\nreputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services, and features,\nor in support of internal business operations, and these applications may become important in our operations over\ntime. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more\nsuccessfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of\noperations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are\nor are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, inappropriate, or biased, or if the use of AI results in, or is alleged\nto have resulted in, the infringement of the intellectual property of third parties or violations of other rights\nof third parties, we may be subject to legal claims or liability and our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI applications may result in data leakage or unauthorized\nexposure of data, including confidential business information, the personal data of end users, or other sensitive\ninformation. Such leakage or unauthorized exposure of data related to the use of AI applications could result in\nlegal claims or liability or otherwise adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents\nemerging ethical and regulatory issues and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or\nreputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. The rapid evolution of AI, including the development of\ngovernment regulation of AI and automated decision-making technology more generally, may require significant\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI\nand automated decision-making technology more generally in a manner that complies with applicable laws and\nregulations and ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and has contained in the past, and may contain in the\nfuture, undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been\nreleased. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of software updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The\nthird-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any\nerrors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in\nnegative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and availability of our platform, as well as other performance\nissues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on\nour platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We may need to expend\nsignificant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or\nto address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects,\nor vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result\nin dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” with respect to RSUs we issue to employees and service providers, pursuant to\nwhich shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of\nthe RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales\nare remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Some holders may instead elect to pay cash directly to us to cover\nsuch withholding obligations, but in a significant majority of cases, shares are sold on behalf of each holder upon\nthe vesting and settlement of the RSUs. While such sales do not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us\nto satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs, such sales cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the\nextent a large number of shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our\nstock price to fluctuate.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required by\nregulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as required\nby Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified\nby any third party and those operational metrics may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third\nparties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and\ntools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which\ncould result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. In addition, while\nwe track these metrics during the quarter, system limitations and the auditing process may result in the metrics\nthat we publicly disclose differing materially from the estimated amounts that were tracked during that same\nperiod. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\ncontain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there\nare inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy\nof our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there\nare consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our terms of service and we implement\nmeasures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the\nnumber of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with\nrespect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could\naffect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if\ninvestors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in our operating metrics and business and we expect that we\ncould be subject to legal claims, including securities class action lawsuits, and our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany loss adjustment expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and\ninsurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive modeling\nand actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our financial statements. If we determine that our estimated\ninsurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination,\nwhich could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively\nimpact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in non-U.S.\njurisdictions, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. Laws\nand regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors vary by jurisdiction and are\nsubject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and\nunpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and consumers that use our platform. For example, in\nJanuary 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor released a final rule regarding the classification of employees and\nindependent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which implements new interpretative guidance\nfor classification of workers.\nWhile we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors,\nDashers may be reclassified as employees due to changes in the law or its interpretation. Depending on the\njurisdiction and the extent of our operations in each such jurisdiction, a reclassification of Dashers as employees\ncould have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nincluding as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to PAGA and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations in order to continue to operate our platform in that jurisdiction,\nwhich would result in significant increased costs and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain\nDashers on our platform, which could have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. A reclassification of Dashers as employees could also result in an increase to the fees\nwe charge to consumers and the commissions we charge to merchants, which in turn could affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumers and merchant partners, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought,\nfor example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees.\nSeveral jurisdictions, including in the United States, have modified, or are considering modifying, their standards\nused to determine worker classification. For example, in July 2024, the Supreme Court of California ruled\nunanimously to uphold the core of Proposition 22, which preserves flexibility for California Dashers. Jurisdictions\nthat have passed or may pass laws protecting Dashers’ independent contractor status may impose new obligations that\nincrease our costs. For example, certain provisions of Proposition 22 regarding compensation, along with certain\nother requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California. These provisions have increased our costs\nrelated to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge\nhigher fees and commissions, which have resulted in, and in the future could result in, lower order volumes over\ntime. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could\nalso lead to a lower Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share.\n31\nTable of Contents\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate have adopted or may be considering, or in the future may consider,\nadopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or\nvoluntary agreements with third parties, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections\nand benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation,\nballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or agreements, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if it becomes\nnecessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely affect our results\nof operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a\ndecision which deemed that Wolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that\nWolt should be mandated to keep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. Although we appealed the\ndecision and, in February 2024, the Administrative Court of Hämeenlinna issued a decision concluding that Wolt\ncourier partners are not in an employment relationship with Wolt, this decision is subject to further appeal and we\nmay be subject to similar actions in other jurisdictions. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing\nthe standards used to determine worker classification, which may impact the classification of Dashers using our\nplatform. For example, the EU's Platform Work Directive, which entered into force in December 2024, requires EU\nmember states to transpose its requirements to their national laws, including enacting new national laws for\ndetermining worker classification of platform workers, and may involve differing implementation by the various\nmember states. Such EU-wide legislative reforms may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent\ncontractor model within the European Economic Area (the \"EEA\").\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, or for\nother reasons, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does, for example, in Germany, which\ncould result in certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain\njurisdictions or decide not to expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth\nand expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands, and other legal, regulatory, and\nother administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker\nclassification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints,\nintellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits,\ngovernment investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. If any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall business, it could cause considerable harm to our business.\nFurther, food and other products that are ordered through our platform could be subject to a recall, but we may\nhave limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses,\nfood and other product recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or\ndelivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, or any related injuries to, or\ndeaths of, any consumers or Dashers, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery\nindustry, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including our\nbackground check processes, removal of platform access, and the nature and frequency of our communications to\nDashers via email, text, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class\nactions, by or relating to consumers regarding,\n32\nTable of Contents\namong other things, disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, consumer fees, gratuities, sign up and\ncancellation of subscription services, the local delivery fulfillment services we facilitate, discrepancies between\nthe items on our websites and consumer applications and the items advertised at the merchants from which such items\nare delivered, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or\ntelephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement. Finally, we face potential\nliability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our websites and mobile\napplications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and negligence, among\nothers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands,\nor other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us,\nwhether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation,\nrequire significant management attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one\nor more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending\nlitigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation.\nThere is no guarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings\ncould also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders\nrequiring a change in our business practices. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other\nlegal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and\ncurrent and former directors and officers. Any of these outcomes and obligations could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or\nbe required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which\ncould also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have exposure to taxing authorities successfully asserting that we have not properly collected or remitted, or\nin the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, similar taxes or withholding\ntaxes, and successfully imposing additional obligations or liabilities on us, and any such assessments,\nobligations, or liabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain and could exceed the amount of any applicable reserves, if any. In addition\nto our own potential liability, if we or merchants pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to\nconsumers, our order volume may decline.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes, in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and\nremit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our\ncalculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do\nnot currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, including tax on the cost of goods sold, and could\nimpose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect\ntaxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so, to\n33\nTable of Contents\ncollect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, or to collect, remit or pay taxes\nthat are otherwise the responsibility of our vendors and partners, could result in substantial tax liabilities,\nincluding taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and\nDashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may\nfail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes.\nThe United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which could result in legislative\naction to increase indirect taxes, including digital services taxes. Such legislative action could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our provision for (benefit\nfrom) income taxes is a function of the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations\nor laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. The determination of our worldwide\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management\nand, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the applicable\nlaw and the ultimate tax determination are uncertain. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from)\nincome taxes is reasonable, the ultimate outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business operations,\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes in our stock price, intercompany\ntransactions, changes in law or administrative interpretations thereof, changes in accounting principles, changes\nto our forecasts of income and loss, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nLegislative changes or administrative practices may increase our tax obligations and exposures and could adversely\naffect our business results and operations.\nThe U.S. federal, state, and local governments, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, such as\nthe European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes\nto existing tax laws and regimes that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do\nbusiness. In addition, regulatory and other guidance, including case law, with respect to existing tax laws are\nconstantly evolving. If one or more of these jurisdictions change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge our\ninterpretations of existing or new tax laws or their application, including how or where our profits and losses are\ncurrently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations may be adversely impacted. For example, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have\nadopted laws, administrative practices or interpretations that impose new tax measures, including but not limited\nto, revenue-based taxes and additional reporting obligations, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of\ngoods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other\ntaxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third-party\nobligations.\nJurisdictions have also proposed or enacted taxes on gross revenue derived from, for example, sales of online\nadvertising services and the provision of digital intermediary services such as the operation of online\nmarketplaces. Proliferation of these or similar tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform\nis implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on\nus prospectively or retroactively, or\n34\nTable of Contents\nadditional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to\nprovide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various\ngovernment agencies. In some cases, we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt\nprocesses to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes is subject to limitations.\nWhile federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to\nexpiration, the deductibility of such NOL carryforwards is limited to 80% of our federal taxable income. Our state\nand non-U.S. NOLs have varying expiration dates going forward. Utilization of our NOL carryforwards depends on our\nfuture taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing NOL carryforwards and tax credits in various\njurisdictions could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable\nincome. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), loss\nutilization is limited if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50\npercentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders\nover a three-year period. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership\nchanges in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a\nresult, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable\nincome or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased\nfuture tax liability to us.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, Dasher deactivations, insurance, merchant pricing and\ncommissions, consumer fees, and taxes. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as worker\nclassification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay and\ninsurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other\nhighly regulated products, online payments, gratuities, merchant pricing and commissions, text messaging,\nmembership products, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data protection, data transfers and sharing,\ncybersecurity, consumer protection, consumer fees, antitrust, background checks, website and mobile application\naccessibility, environmental sustainability and related disclosures, and tax and other government-imposed fees are\noften complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of\nspecificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain\nand may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between U.S. law and the laws of other\ncountries, between U.S. state and federal law, between individual states, and even at the city and municipality\nlevel. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as\nnew guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies. For example, the scope and\ninterpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving\nand developing and, in particular, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us.\nWe are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and local laws\nregulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products. These regulations and\nlaws may dictate matters such as licensing, permitting, or other governmental review requirements, advertising\nrestrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our operations\nresulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or changes to the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or regulations could\nresult in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of highly regulated products in a\njurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased sales or marketing costs, or changes to our business\npractices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we have become\nsubject to a growing array of laws and regulations, which increase the complexity and compliance risk inherent in\nour business. For example, the EU has recently enacted, and is in the process of enacting, various laws and\nregulations that govern digital services and AI, and impose environmental sustainability obligations and disclosure\nrequirements on businesses like ours. The impact of these new regulations on the overall industry, business models,\nand our operations is\n35\nTable of Contents\nuncertain. We may be required to enhance our disclosures and undertake certain changes to our products, services,\nfees and commissions structure, and operations, including hiring additional highly specialized personnel, as a\nresult of these new requirements, which could subject us to increased administrative costs.\nIn recent years, regulatory scrutiny of larger companies, technology companies, and companies engaged in dealings\nwith independent contractors has increased. As a result, regulatory and administrative bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and\nregulations differently than they have in the past in a manner adverse to our business, including by changing\nemployment-related laws, mandating specific earnings standards or other requirements for Dashers, requiring\nbusinesses like ours to maintain specific auto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions\nbusinesses like ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in December\n2023, a New York City rule mandating certain minimum earnings standards for certain food delivery workers took\neffect. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in effect on local commerce\nplatforms. These price control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar regulations can increase the cost\nand complexity of operating, which has caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to\nconsumers. To the extent that price control measures, minimum earnings standards, or similar regulations lead to an\nincrease in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further\nharm our business and results of operations. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge or seek to regulate\nthe way in which we categorize, disclose, or collect consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of\nChicago has challenged such fees as confusing or misleading to consumers.\nIn addition, there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment regarding antitrust and\ncompetition matters in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We could be subject to claims\nof violations of competition laws in many aspects of our business, including alleged market sharing, price fixing,\nanticompetitive exclusionary conduct, exchange of competitively sensitive information, and with respect to any\nacquisitions we undertake. For example, competition authorities in some of the jurisdictions in which Wolt operates\nhave made queries regarding, or investigated, Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices and competition\nauthorities and courts have issued decisions concerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices. Any\npotential violations of competition laws could result in litigation, fines, restrictions on our operations, render\napplicable provisions or contracts unenforceable, divert management’s attention, and lead to claims for damages and\nreputational harm, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nAny failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and\nregulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a\nresult of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth\nof our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and\n36\nTable of Contents\nas we increase sales and operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-\nbribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media\ncoverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil\nsanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s\nattention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define \"money transmitter\"\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider and electronic money\ninstitution for its payment services to merchants in the EEA countries and has obtained a payment institution\nlicense and electronic money license from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II.\nShould our payment institution or electronic money licenses be revoked in the future, or any other enforcement\nmeasures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease\noffering certain payment facilities, our operations in Europe would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we\nexpand into new jurisdictions and expand or pursue new business opportunities, the payment-related regulations that\nwe are subject to will expand as well, including, for example, with respect to the provision of payments and\nfinancial services we offer in Israel. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules\nand regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of\nsignificant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant changes to our\nbusiness practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt our ability to\noperate in certain jurisdictions and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution,\nsocial media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications,\nconsumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is\nnot always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel,\nand personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally,\nit is possible that non-U.S. government entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or\nwebsites or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived\nfailure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand,\na loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, process, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that use our platform, as well as other personal data relating to our employees and other personnel. We are\nsubject to a growing body of local, municipal, state, federal, national, and international laws and regulations in\nthe jurisdictions where we operate that address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and\nprotection of certain types of data, which may require the notification of certain security breaches involving\npersonal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change through new\nlegislation, amendments to\n37\nTable of Contents\nexisting legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to\nanother. For example, many U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy legislation similar to the California\nConsumer Privacy Act and a growing number of U.S. states have enacted legislation addressing other privacy matters,\nsuch as cybersecurity and consumer health data and biometrics. With our operations in the EU, we are subject to the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation, as well as national data protection and privacy schemes in other countries in\nwhich we operate. Any changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement could add further\ncomplexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of resources in\ncompliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in business practices\nand policies. For example, new and evolving requirements around consumer health data may restrict our ability to\nprovide personalized content on our platform. These laws also impose strict and sometimes inconsistent requirements\nrelating to the processing of personal data as well as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against\nthe processing of personal data, and civil litigation claims, for noncompliance. We have incurred, and expect to\ncontinue to incur, significant expenses in our efforts to comply with current and evolving privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or\ncontractual obligations.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures designed to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be\ncontractually required to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third\nparties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations\nrelating to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part on our ability to access, collect, use, and otherwise process data\nrelating to Dashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as\n“cookies,” is further restricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, litigation, or other practices,\nthe amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted or are considering\nenacting legislation or regulations that significantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators\nare increasingly scrutinizing the use of online tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the\nonline behavioral advertising ecosystem. Moreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as\nApple and Google, plan to or have implemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking\ntechnologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted,\nsignificantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. As a result, we may have to develop\nalternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently market\nto them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, or cybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or\nrelease of personal data or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the\nperception of privacy concerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could\ndamage our reputation and brand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our\nplatform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and\nlitigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, security and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire\ninsurance. We may also choose to self-insure for certain types of claims or for certain claims below or above\ncertain dollar amounts. Even if we do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or\ndeductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our\n38\nTable of Contents\ninsurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In\naddition, if any of our insurance providers terminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their\nrelationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate insurance providers\nand may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of\nour agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain\nand maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of these merchant agreements and could be\nsubject to additional liabilities as a result.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. In addition, if we were to experience an\nunusually large amount of operations-related claims that we self-insure, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Even if operations-related claims do not result in liability, we may incur\nsignificant costs in investigating and defending against them.\nInsurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a\nresult, our insurance and claims expenses could increase substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles\nor self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims\nsignificantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience claims in excess of our\ncoverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a\nsignificant claim or claims for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles\nor self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily Stripe and\nPayPal. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nWe also provide Dashers in the U.S. with access to certain banking services that facilitate, among other things,\nimmediate access to their earnings. Through this offering we act as a service provider to a bank and are\ncontractually bound to adhere to certain banking or financial regulations that could subject us to regulatory\nreview, proceedings, or audits pursuant to federal or state laws, as well as the risk of contractual breach and\nindemnification.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, banking, anti-money\nlaundering, and similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors or the\nservices that we offer to our Dashers, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and\nproceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept\nonline payments or other payment card transactions or provide certain services to our Dashers, which could make our\nplatform less convenient and attractive to consumers and Dashers. We also rely on data provided by our payment\nservice provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected. Additionally, these relationships require us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks, and certain other banking or financial\nregulations. These networks and other applicable authorities could adopt new rules or regulations or interpret or\nre-interpret existing rules or regulations in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some\nusers or Dashers, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, or lose our ability to offer access to\ncertain services that benefit Dashers, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely\n39\nTable of Contents\naffected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and\nfines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers, and if such providers fail to\nprovide accurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on accredited third-party background check providers to assist with\nverifying the authenticity of Dashers and to provide the criminal and/or driving history of potential Dashers and,\nin some cases, existing Dashers, to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to\napplicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers\ndo not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations.\nIf any of our third-party background check providers fails to perform as expected, terminates its relationship with\nus or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find alternate\nproviders, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. In\ncertain jurisdictions, including Canada and the United States, we currently rely on a single third-party background\ncheck provider. In other jurisdictions, we rely on a very limited number of background check providers. If the need\narises, and we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not\nbe able to timely onboard potential Dashers and, as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential\nDashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background\nchecks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our\nexpectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform and, as a result, we may be\nunable to adequately help protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers. Conversely,\ninaccurate background checks may inadvertently exclude qualified Dashers from our platform. As a result of\ninaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-\nparty background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may\ncontinue to have access to, and complete deliveries through, our platform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face regulatory or legal action, including class, collective, or other\nrepresentative actions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including investigations, lawsuits,\ninquiries, and demand letters, related to our background check review process and the notice requirements around\nbackground checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions\nbased on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks\nadequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where there are no industry-specific regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks, in\naccordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we choose background checks that are less thorough in scope\nthan we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or regulation, or if we fail to run additional background\nchecks after Dashers are onboarded, we may face negative publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other security incidents, or our actual or\nperceived failure to take action on negative results of a background or other check that we may initiate with\nrespect to a Dasher, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased\nregulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform, services, and operations depend on a wide variety of third-party software and services and any\ninterruption in services provided by these third parties could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nWe have integrations with or otherwise utilize or rely on PayPal, Stripe, Olo, Google Maps, Amazon Web Services\n(\"AWS\"), and a variety of other third-party vendors. Our business would be disrupted, and we may have to seek\nalternative service providers, if any of the third-party software or services we utilize, or functional equivalents\nthereof, were unavailable due to, among other reasons, extended outages or interruptions or because they are no\nlonger available on commercially reasonable terms or prices. Third-party software, applications, products,\nplatforms, and services, and the\n40\nTable of Contents\nterms on which they are offered, are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform\nto ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings. Updates to third-party software that integrates with our\nofferings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously had or at all. In addition, some\nof our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform\nwith their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to operate and distribute\nour platform. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our platform or give preferential\ntreatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our platform.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by AWS, a third-party provider\nof cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will continue to experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability due to a\nvariety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors or misconduct, natural disasters,\ncybersecurity events, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. Although it would be difficult for a\nnumber of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud infrastructure providers on\ncommercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated, not\navailable on the same terms, or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience\nsignificant costs or downtime, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn certain markets, we regularly engage fleet companies to fulfill deliveries on our platform. Fleet companies are\nthird parties that provide delivery services using their own workforce or, in some cases, their own subcontractors.\nOur operations in some markets may be heavily dependent on the services of fleet companies. To the extent that we\ndo become reliant on fleet companies in certain markets, it may be difficult to find a suitable replacement for the\nfulfillment services that such fleet companies provide in a timely manner or at all. In addition, if fleet\ncompanies operate below appropriate quality standards or have compliance or other regulatory issues, our business,\nreputation and results of operations could be adversely affected in those markets. Although we contractually\nrequire our fleet partners to comply with applicable law in their operations, we do not control these companies and\nany non-compliance with applicable law has resulted in, and may in the future result in, increased legal and\nregulatory exposure and increased resourcing needs. In the event that our relationship with any of our key\npartners, including fleet companies, deteriorates, whether as a result of business disputes, regulatory issues, or\ndegrading quality of services, we may experience difficulties maintaining our operations in impacted markets, which\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, in 2021, Apple imposed\nrequirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and implemented an application tracking\ntransparency framework that requires\n41\nTable of Contents\nopt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned to adopt restrictions\nto restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that these changes will\ncontinue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions. If we are unable to mitigate\nthe effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates\nfrom existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through Internet search results on search engines\nlike Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and\nwhere our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its\nranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not\nbe prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality, obtain and\nuse information that we consider proprietary, or use branding that is confusingly similar to our own. In addition,\nunauthorized parties may also attempt, or successfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential\ninformation, and trade secrets through various methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other\nmethods of protecting this data may be inadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt and use service names and domain names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build\nbrand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or\ntrademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks or domain\nnames. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not\ntimely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property.\nOur efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open source licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license.\nThis could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately\ncould result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected portions of our source\ncode, we could be required to purchase additional licenses and expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer\nsome or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately\naddress the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or non-U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nThere have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of\nwhat we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the\nterms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be\nrequired to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-\nengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our\nproprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. We may seek\n43\nTable of Contents\nadditional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, or investments and our\nongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we\nissue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We\nmay evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among\nother things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the\ncapital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable\nto us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we\nrequire it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be\nimpaired, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, pay\ndividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments and loans, or engage in transactions with\naffiliates. We are also required to comply with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined\nin accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital\nneeds. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our\nbusiness strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such\nrestrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility, to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and to require cash collateral for\nany outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated or such cash collateral were to be required, we may not have sufficient cash\nor be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which\ncould immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even\nif we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are\nacceptable to us. As of December 31, 2024, there were no revolving loans outstanding and $112 million in aggregate\nface amount of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2024, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of LaunchPad, and a member\nof our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of\ndirectors collectively held 51% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting\npower may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those\nequity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering and subject to equity exchange right\nagreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares\nof Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the\nvesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of\nClass B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had\nbeen exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2024, our Co-Founders\nwould collectively hold 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered\ninto the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and\nvote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and\npermitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will\nbe able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including\nthe election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to\n44\nTable of Contents\nour certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or\nour Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, which we\nsometimes refer to herein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total\ndisability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as\ndirected by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and\nno more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61\ndays and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an\nofficer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result\nof Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our\nstockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which\nsuch final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would\nhave no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting\ndilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common\nstock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares\nof Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has\nbeen met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\ncontrol of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our\nCo-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve\nliquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C\ncommon stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of\nNasdaq.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of Nasdaq, we\nexpect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain\nreduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2024, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of Nasdaq. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for\nthe election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may\nelect not to comply with certain\n45\nTable of Contents\nlisting standards of Nasdaq regarding corporate governance, including requirements that a majority of its board of\ndirectors consist of independent directors, a compensation committee be composed of independent directors, and that\nthere is independent director oversight over the director nomination process.\nSuch corporate governance requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the\n“controlled company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely\non these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the protections for other\nstockholders.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these\nestimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\n46\nTable of Contents\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.1 billion. Under existing or any future share repurchase\nprograms, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases, block\ntransactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our\nshare repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares,\nand may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases,\nif any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements, such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any\nfailure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and\ninvestor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n47\nTable of Contents\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our\nmarket, or if they change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading\nvolume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, publish more favorable analyses about\nour competitors than us, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our\nsecurities would likely decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate declaring or paying\nany dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment."

We have an\nenterprise-wide cybersecurity program that is designed to identify, protect, detect, and respond to reasonably\nforeseeable cybersecurity risk and threats, and continuously work to enhance and improve our cybersecurity and risk\nmanagement efforts.We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats and maintain incident response\nplans designed to protect, identify, evaluate, respond to, and recover from a cybersecurity incident. The plans are\ndesigned to be flexible so that they may be adapted to an array of potential scenarios, and provide for the\ncreation of cross-functional cybersecurity incident response teams in the event of a cybersecurity incident. We\nregularly conduct exercises to help ensure our overall preparedness for a cybersecurity incident.\nWe also have invested in tools and technologies to protect our data and information technology, and we monitor our\nsystems on an ongoing basis to identify and assess risk. In addition, we have mandatory cybersecurity training\ndesigned to educate and train employees on how to identify and report cybersecurity threats. We also provide\nspecialized training for employees in more sensitive roles.\nWe take measures to assess and, where warranted, update and improve our cybersecurity program, including by\nregularly conducting internal risk assessments, internal control validations, independent program assessments,\nthreat assessments, penetration testing, and scanning of our systems for vulnerabilities. Our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement framework is based on applicable laws and regulations, as well as industry recognized standards and\npractices, including a system and organization controls 2 (SOC 2 type II) examination for certain DoorDash\nOperations (as defined below), an ISO 27001 certification for certain Wolt Operations (as defined below), and an\nannual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment card\ninformation. We undergo periodic third-party assessments against recognized industry standards and practices,\nincluding an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment\ncard information. We also periodically engage third-party advisors to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity\nprogram, policies and practices, consult with external advisors regarding opportunities and enhancements to\nstrengthen our policies and practices, and assess our cybersecurity capabilities using third-party security firms.\nOur internal audit team provides independent assessment of our cybersecurity program and controls.\nWith respect to third-party service providers, our cybersecurity program includes conducting due diligence and\nvendor risk assessment of relevant service providers’ cybersecurity programs prior to onboarding, as well as\nongoing monitoring through our third-party risk management policies and programs. We also contractually require\nthird-party service providers with access to our information technology systems, sensitive business data, or\npersonal information to implement and maintain appropriate security controls and provide for contractual\nrestrictions on their ability to use our data. We work with these third-party service providers to help ensure\ntheir cybersecurity protocols are appropriate to the risk presented by\n49\nTable of Contents\ntheir access to or use of our systems and/or data, including notification and coordination concerning incidents\noccurring on third-party systems that may affect us.Our service providers are contractually required to notify us\npromptly of security incidents that may affect our systems or data, including personal information.\nTo date, risks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected our business or operations. Although we have\ninvested in the protection of our data and information technology, and monitor our systems on an ongoing basis,\nthere can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful in preventing our information technology systems\nfrom being compromised or otherwise protecting us completely from security breaches or incidents. For additional\ninformation regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity\nincidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, please see the section titled \"Risk Factors,\" in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “ Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and\nOperations— We have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future\nattacks. Any actual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our\noperations, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations .”\nGovernance\nOur board of directors is responsible for overseeing risk management for the Company and administers this\nresponsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. Our board of directors has designated our\naudit committee to administer oversight of cybersecurity risk management, which is a critical component of our\nenterprise risk management program. As such, our audit committee receives regular updates on our cybersecurity\nprogram and is actively involved in reviewing our cybersecurity and technology risks and opportunities, risk\nmitigation strategies, incident and industry trends, areas of emerging risks, and other areas of importance,\nincluding with respect to cybersecurity. Security updates are also provided to the full board of directors from\ntime to time.\nThe Company's cybersecurity risk management is jointly led by (i) for all operations other than our Wolt Operations\n(“DoorDash Operations”), DoorDash, Inc.’s Director of Security Governance, Risk, and Compliance, who is currently\nserving as interim security lead(the “Interim Security Lead”) while the Company onboards a new Chief Information\nSecurity Officer, and (ii) for our international operations conducted under Wolt and its subsidiaries (“Wolt\nOperations”), Wolt’s Chief Security Officer. The Interim Security Lead is responsible for assessing and managing\ninformation security and technology risks for DoorDash Operations and reports to the General Counsel.She has worked\nin security and technology for over 17 years, with the last 10 years spent in security leadership. She holds a\nbachelor's degree in finance and management information systems from the University of Maryland. Wolt’s Chief\nSecurity Officer is responsible for assessing and managing information security, technology, and physical security\nand safety risks for Wolt Operations, and reports to the Chief Executive Officer of Wolt. He has worked in security\nand technology for over 30 years. Each of their respective teams are composed of experienced personnel with a broad\nrange of experience across the technology industry.\nManagement is responsible for assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks, and both the\nInterim Security Lead and Wolt’s Chief Security Officer and their respective teams meet regularly with each other\nand with members of management to review and evaluate our cybersecurity risks and risk management program. As part\nof its oversight of cybersecurity risks, our audit committee receives regular updates on the risks and status of\nboth the DoorDash and Wolt security programs. Both programs have in place coordinated cybersecurity incident\nresponse processes that set forth procedures for managing and responding to cybersecurity incidents across the\nenterprise, including the assignment of cross-functional roles and responsibilities and protocols for the\nescalation of significant incidents to members of management and our audit committee."

Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. When\nwe determine that we have meritorious defenses to any claims asserted, we defend ourselves vigorously; however we\nalso consider settlement of disputes when, in management’s judgment, it is in the best interests of both DoorDash\nand its shareholders to do so. For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of\nthe amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that\ncould potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal\nProceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded or non-monetary damages.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under California\nLabor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and\nother matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. Various other\nDashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our\nplatform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers,\nwith many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent\ncontractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nfiled an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified\nCalifornia Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and\nthe California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages\nand a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September\n2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was\napproved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners\nconsisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County\nSuperior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as\nunconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California First\nDistrict Court of Appeal. In March 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned the Alameda County Superior Court's ruling\nand upheld nearly all of Proposition 22 as state law. In April 2023, petitioners consisting of a number of\nindividuals and labor groups filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of California, which was granted in\nJune 2023.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2024, the Supreme Court of California upheld the Court of Appeal's March 2023 ruling, leaving nearly all of\nProposition 22 in place as state law.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws, and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies\nconcerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models,\ncompliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, cybersecurity, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’\ncompensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development\nDepartment of the State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD\nissued a negative assessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA\nEDD’s assessment, and intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is\nuncertain and, accordingly, we have recorded an accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. We are currently the subject of government\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries in other jurisdictions as well, and we may in the future settle, or\nrecord accruals with respect to, such matters. Further, the results of investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an\ninvestigation, audit, demand, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or\nunfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse\nimpact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors."

Our mission is to grow\nand empower local economies. We aim to do this by providing services that reduce friction in local commerce and\nhelp merchants better connect with consumers in their communities.\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), and our\nCommerce Platform. Our Marketplaces operate in over 30 countries across the globe and provide an integrated suite\nof services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect with consumers in their communities, and\nsolve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand generation, order fulfillment,\nmerchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also offer advertising as a value-added service through\nour Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies increase consumer engagement and drive\nincremental revenue.\nOur Marketplaces compete for consumers based primarily on the selection, convenience, quality, affordability, and\nservice we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our consumer membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to\nlower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge, while providing additional\nmembership benefits.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer our Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help merchants\ngrow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive (together,\n\"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within our Commerce\nPlatform. In addition to Drive, we also provide services that help merchants establish online ordering, build\nbranded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nWe use the following financial and operational metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting\nour business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except percentages)                                2022            2023            2024\nTotal Orders                                                    1,736           2,161           2,583\nTotal Orders Y/Y growth                                            25  %           24  %           20  %\nMarketplace GOV                            $                   53,414       $  66,771       $  80,231\nMarketplace GOV Y/Y growth                                         27  %           25  %           20  %\nRevenue                                    $                    6,583       $   8,635       $  10,722\nRevenue Y/Y growth                                                 35  %           31  %           24  %\nNet Revenue Margin                                               12.3  %         12.9  %         13.4  %\nGAAP gross profit                          $                    2,824       $   3,860       $   4,979\nGAAP gross profit as a % of Marketplace                           5.3  %          5.8  %          6.2  %\nGOV\nContribution Profit(1)                     $                    1,567       $   2,482       $   3,474\nContribution Profit as a % of                                     2.9  %          3.7  %          4.3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to     $                   -1,365       $    -558       $     123\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders as a                          -2.6  %         -0.8  %          0.2  %\n% of Marketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                         $                      361       $   1,190       $   1,900\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                             0.7  %          1.8  %          2.4  %\nGOV\nWeighted-average diluted shares                                   371             393             430\noutstanding\n(1) Contribution Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures.

Foreign jurisdictions\nhave different statutory tax rates than those in the U.S. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be\ntaxable in the U.S.\nAccordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes\nin our stock price, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit\ndevelopments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and\nlosses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\nrelated to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in\nvarious jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.\nAdditionally, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses varies depending on the amount of pre-tax\nincome or loss. For example, the impact of any particular item is greater when the amount of our pre-tax income or\nloss is smaller.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Finland. We expect to maintain these\nvaluation allowances until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be\nrealized by way of expected future taxable income in the U.S. and Finland.\n(in millions,                    Year Ended\nexcept                         December 31,\npercentages)                           2022       2023       2024    2023 to 2024       $ Change    % Change\nProvision for\n(benefit from)        $                 -31    $    31    $    39                    $         8              *\nincome\ntaxes\n* Percentage not meaningful .\nIn 2024, the income tax expense increased by $8 million compared to 2023. The increase in income tax expense was\nprimarily driven by U.S. pre-tax book income and the resulting increase in U.S. cash tax liabilities, partially\noffset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which a tax benefit can be realized.\nGiven our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that\nsufficient positive evidence may become available in a future period to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation\nallowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of U.S.\nfederal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release\nis recorded. The exact timing and amount of any potential valuation allowance release are subject to change on the\nbasis of our level of sustained U.S. profitability, as well as the amount of our tax deductible stock-based\ncompensation, which is dependent upon our publicly traded share price, and macroeconomic conditions, among other\nfactors.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 – \"Income Taxes\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense,\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our\nbusiness and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ninvestors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance\nand future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors\nin seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of\nour business over multiple periods and with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted\nresearch and development expense,\n61\nTable of Contents\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes\nfor, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free\nCash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures.

These excluded\ncosts and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our\nhistorical Dasher pay model, and a settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve\nunderrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and settlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection\nof sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to\nsupporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and\nprice controls, and (iv) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of\nadjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable\nand thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification\nmatters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long\nterm as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of\nProposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\nContribution Profit\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is\na useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct\nexpenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. It is not a financial measure of total company\nprofitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total company profitability nor imply\nprofitability for our business.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders,\nadjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and exclude (i) certain\nlegal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment,\n(iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs),\n(iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii)\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest income, net, (ix) other expense, net, (x) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nBeginning with fiscal year 2024, we now present net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common\nstockholders as the most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA and we have changed our presentation of the\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc.\ncommon stockholders. We believe this is an important measure used by investors to assess the health and performance\nof our operations and that this presentation better reflects the comparison of that performance to the most\ncomparable GAAP measure impacting DoorDash stockholders. We are continuing to show both net income (loss)\nattributable to DoorDash, Inc.\n64\nTable of Contents\ncommon stockholders and net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests so that investors can\neasily compare our historical presentations.

These excluded costs and expenses consist\nof (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our historical Dasher pay model, and\na settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve underrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and\nsettlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection of sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do\nnot expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including\nthose related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and price controls, and (iv) donations as part of\nour relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is\nappropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and\nmagnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process,\nand (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be\nmaterial to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory\ncertainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\n(2) Consists primarily of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment.\n(3) Excludes stock-based compensation related to restructuring, which is included in restructuring charges in the\ntable above.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and\ncapitalized software and website development costs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                                  2022        2023        2024\nNet cash provided by operating           $                      367    $  1,673    $  2,132\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment                            -176        -123        -104\nCapitalized software and website                               -170        -201        -226\ndevelopment costs\nFree Cash Flow                           $                       21    $  1,349    $  1,802\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                     -300    $   -342    $   -444\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                     -375    $   -752    $   -204\nCredit Facility\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with certain lenders, which, as\nmost recently amended and restated on April 26, 2024, provides for an $800 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on April 26, 2029, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face\namount of up to $600 million. As\n65\nTable of Contents\nof December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nAs amended and restated, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, as well as customary\nnegative covenants that restrict our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary\nindebtedness, grant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or\nconsolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole,\nmake investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also maintain\ncompliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, no revolving loans were outstanding and $115 million and\n$112 million of letters of credit were issued under our revolving credit facility, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $6.2 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.3 billion and long-term marketable securities of $835 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $436 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. Marketable securities consisted of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $5.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2024. We have historically funded our operations from cash from operations as well as\nthe issuance of equity securities, including in our initial public offering in December 2020. To execute on our\nstrategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash\nflows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the available borrowings under our revolving\ncredit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the\nnext 12 months and beyond.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $876\nmillion remained available under the repurchase authorization.\nIn February 2025, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion, which is inclusive of the remaining share\nrepurchase authority of $876 million under the share repurchase program that we previously announced in February\n2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated\ntransactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market\nrepurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We\nmay also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock\nunder this authorization. We may or may not repurchase any portion of the total authorized amount, and the timing\nand actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and\nmarket conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, the expansion\nof sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                  2022        2023        2024\nNet cash provided by operating           $                      367    $  1,673    $  2,132\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                          -300        -342        -444\nNet cash used in financing activities                          -375        -752        -204\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                           -10           5         -35\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash    $                     -318    $    584    $  1,449\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion for 2024 .

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our\n67\nTable of Contents\nestimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial\nstatement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which\nis recognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a\nratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of\nmembership purchased by the consumer. We also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees\nfrom merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated\nthrough their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control\nof the merchant’s products.\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local\ncommerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as we do not have the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor do we\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\n68\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance that includes retained insurance deductibles to insure costs, including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate\nof our ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss\nexperience. We use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss development\nfactors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are\nperiodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However,\nultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies, and we\nbelieve that determining the impact of market sensitivities on these investments is not practicable.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $46 million and $42 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Adjustments or impairments are recorded in other expense, net on the\nconsolidated statements of operations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome (loss) from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international\nbusinesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Based on\nour foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, we estimated that a\n10% change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity.\n70\nTable of Contents"

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n72\nTable of Contents\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which\ninclude retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate of the Company’s retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves as of December 31, 2024 was $1.0 billion.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 14,

Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nRestricted cash consists of bank accounts that are legally restricted for use, including certain amounts collected\non the behalf of, but not yet remitted to, merchants, which are restricted in compliance with certain regulatory\nrequirements, and collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and\ninsurance policies. Restricted cash is classified as either current or non-current assets based on the estimated\nterm of the remaining restriction.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and mutual funds. The Company invests in a diversified\nportfolio of marketable securities and limits the concentration of its investment in any particular security.\nSecurities with maturities greater than three months, but less than one year, are included in current assets and\nsecurities with maturities greater than one year are included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance\nsheets. All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company\nevaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors considered in\ndetermining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost\nbasis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for\ncredit losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is limited\nby the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis. When a credit loss\nexists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with\nthe amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was recorded. Unrealized\nlosses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher and merchant payouts. Funds held\nat payment\n81\nTable of Contents\nprocessors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with consumers, as well as\nfunds transferred to payment processors for Dasher and merchant payouts.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive and Marketplace related offerings. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on\nthe Company’s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the\nallowance for credit losses on a collective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each\ncustomer’s expected ability to pay and collection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts\nreceivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “ Impairment of Long-Lived A ssets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2024 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Nogoodwill impairment charge was\nrecorded in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities that the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative).\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar investment of the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\n82\nTable of Contents\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurs costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance that includes retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate\nof the Company’s ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss\nexperience. The Company utilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss\ndevelopment factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates.\nReserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes\nknown. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could result in losses over the\nCompany’s reserved amounts.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded additions to the insurance reserves\nof $ 359million, $ 518million and $ 526million, respectively. The Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $ 758million and $ 1.0billion, respectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into\nU.S. dollars.\n83\nTable of Contents\nAssets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are translated\nusing average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant. With the exception of the CEO Performance Award and options assumed via acquisition (as\ndiscussed further in Note 10 - \"Common Stock\"), the Company only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a\nservice-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as discussed below in Note 10 - \"Common Stock\"), which includes a market-based\ncondition, the fair value of the award was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-\nbased compensation is recorded over the derived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the\nstock price goals are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based\ncompensation expense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu\ncontinues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the\nrequisite service period, regardless of whether the stock price goals are achieved.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The\nCompany recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the\nenactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that\nit believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and\nnegative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future income,\nand other relevant factors. Our judgment regarding levels of future profitability are consistent with plans and\nestimates used to manage the business; however, actual operating results in future years could differ from our\ncurrent assumptions, judgments and estimates. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease, as applicable, in the period in which the assessment\nis changed.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which\nmay require periodic adjustments. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate\nsettlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefit may differ significantly from\nthe estimates. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\n84\nTable of Contents\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that\nthe institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases\nof debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit losses\nhistorically.\nPayment processors are financial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit\nquality. The Company retains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in\nfunds held at payment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be\nremitted to Dashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the\nCompany pre-authorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive and Marketplace related offerings.As of December 31, 2023, one entity in dividually accounted for 13% of\naccounts receivable, net. As of December 31, 2024, one entity in dividually accounted for 13% of accounts\nreceivable, net. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and\n2024.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through its Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of the Marketplaces . Revenue generated from the\nCompany’s DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\ncommerce platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local commerce platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\n85\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item\nseparately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable\nas the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service\nindividually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through its Marketplaces. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled within a week.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-added services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. The majority of gift cards\nsold have no expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. The Company also estimates the portion of outstanding gift cards that\nwill never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed\ngift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage\namounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. The Company\nrecorded $ 47million, $ 41million and $ 46million of gift card breakage revenue during the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and\nhistorical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate. For jurisdictions\nwhere gift cards have expiration dates, the Company recognizes breakage when they expire.\n86\nTable of Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local commerce platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below.\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. The majority of new consumer acquisition costs is expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 1.1billion, $ 1.3billion, and $ 1.3billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per common share following the two-class method required for multiple\nclasses of common stock and participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and\nparticipating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the\nperiod had been distributed. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights.\nAccordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B\n87\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net income and losses. Noshares of Class C common stock were\nissued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\nby the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to\nrepurchase. The diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per\ncommon share is the same as basic net loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-\ndilutive. Vested RSUs that have not been settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to\ncalculate basic and diluted net income (loss) per share.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient of not recognizing ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from twoto six years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual\nvalue guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if it has a variable\ninterest in an entity and if it is the primary beneficiary. These evaluations are complex and involve judgment and\nthe use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other\nfactors. If the Company determines that entities for which the Company holds a contractual or ownership interest in\nare variable interest entities (\"VIE\") and that the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates\nsuch entities in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets\nboth of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either\ncase could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in the\ninterest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether the Company is still the primary\nbeneficiary. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the\ninvestment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer\n88\nTable of Contents\nto Note 14 - \"Variable Interest Entities\" of these notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information.\nRestructuring\nCosts and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are\nincurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless\nfuture service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Ongoing employee\ntermination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is\nreasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated\nstatements of operations and related liabilities are recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates\nbased on currently available information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. ASU\n2023-07 expands segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description\nof its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and\nassets. Additionally, the amendments require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of\nhow the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding\nhow to allocate resources. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required for entities with a single\nreportable segment. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07\non January 1, 2024 and applied the amendment retrospectively to all prior periods presented on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements. See Note 15 – \"Segment Reporting\" of these notes to the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements for additional information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense\nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"), which\nrequires disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of specified information about certain costs and expenses in\nthe notes to financial statements. ASU 2024-03 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial\nstatements and disclosures.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomposed of the Company's Marketplaces and Commerce Platform.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022        2023         2024\nUnited States       $                    6,251    $  7,781    $   9,403\nInternational(1)                           332         854        1,319\nTotal revenue       $                    6,583    $  8,635    $  10,722\n(1) No individual country outside the United States represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenue for the\nperiods presented.\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance\n89\nTable of Contents\nsheets, is primarily composed of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers and merchants, certain\nconsumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over time. A summary of\nactivities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nBeginning balance                          $                           308\nAddition to contract liabilities                                     2,813\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                             -2,725\nEnding balance                             $                           396\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 181million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. The ending\nbalance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities\nrelated to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022       2023       2024\nBeginning balance                          $                       62    $   100    $   137\nAddition to deferred contract costs                                70         82         80\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                           -32        -45        -60\nEnding balance                             $                      100    $   137    $   157\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                       36    $    51    $    64\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                               64         86         93\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                      100    $   137    $   157\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022       2023       2024\nBeginning balance                           $                       39    $    20    $    17\nCurrent-period provision for expected                                —          8         15\ncredit losses\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance                           -19        -11        -10\nEnding balance                              $                       20    $    17    $    22\n4. Acquisitions\nWolt Acquisition\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of Wolt\nEnterprise Oy (“Wolt”). Wolt was acquired to help the Company accelerate its product development, increase its\ninternational scale, bring greater focus to its markets outside the United States, and improve the value provided\nto\n90\nTable of Contents\nconsumers, merchants, and Dashers around the world. The Company’s acquisition-related costs were $ 48million and\nall costs were recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations during the period in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred for Wolt was $ 2,838million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nDoorDash Class A common stock             $       2,705\nStock-based compensation awards\n(DoorDash options, RSUs, and revesting                   133\ncommon stock) attributable to\npre-combination services\nTotal consideration                       $       2,838\nThe fair value of 36million shares of Class A common stock issued was determined on the basis of the closing market\nprice of the Company’s Class A common stock on the acquisition date. The Company also issued certain stock-based\ncompensation awards and their fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\napplicable assumptions as of the acquisition date for options ( 1.7million DoorDash options) and using the closing\nmarket price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date for RSUs ( 1.4million DoorDash RSUs).\nFor certain Wolt employees, a portion of their total consideration transferred was restricted subject to revesting\nover a service period, including 568thousand shares of the Company's Class A common stock. This restricted equity\nconsideration is considered compensation for post-combination services and is being recognized as stock-based\ncompensation expense over the four yearperiod following the acquisition, based on the fair value of the shares\nusing the closing market price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Wolt acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 1,997million of goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Wolt and anticipated synergies from the\nfuture growth and strategic advantages in the global local commerce industry. The goodwill recorded in connection\nwith the acquisition of Wolt is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, with the assistance of an independent third-party\nvaluation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMay 31, 2022\nCurrent assets                   $           272\nIntangible assets                            772\nGoodwill                                   1,997\nOther non-current assets                      82\nCurrent liabilities                         -204\nDeferred tax liability, net                  -34\nOther non-current liabilities                -47\nTotal purchase price             $         2,838\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful life as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       May 31, 2022\nMerchant relationships                            11    $           236\nTrademark                                         10                268\nExisting technology                                6                150\nCustomer relationships                             3                107\nCourier relationships                              1                 11\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $           772\n91\nTable of Contents\nExisting technology represents the existing online and mobile Wolt platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and\npickup orders. The merchant, customer, and courier relationships represent the fair value of the underlying\nrelationships with merchants, such as restaurants and grocery stores, users of Wolt’s food and delivery services,\nand courier partners. The estimated fair values of the existing technology and trademarks were determined using a\nrelief from royalty method. The fair values of the merchant, courier and customer relationships were determined\nusing a replacement cost method. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a\nstraight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\nFrom the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022, the amount of revenue and net loss from Wolt included in\nthe consolidated statements of operations were $ 259million and $ 345million, respectively.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Wolt acquisition had\nbeen completed on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2021. The unaudited pro forma information\nis based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and primarily reflects adjustments\nfor the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets and\ntransaction costs. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not\nnecessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the\nacquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021, nor are they indicative of future results of operations. The unaudited\npro forma results were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenue     $                         6,734\nNet loss    $                        -1,549\nBbot Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired Bbot, a hospitality technology company. The addition of Bbot's products and\ntechnology to the Company's platform offers merchants more solutions for their in-store and online channels,\nincluding in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of\naccounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $ 9million\nindemnification holdback, which was settled during the three month period ended June 30, 2023.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's best estimate and assumptions,\nwith the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMarch 1, 2022\nCurrent assets          $             11\nIntangible assets                     18\nGoodwill                              60\nOther liabilities                     -1\nTotal purchase price    $             88\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology and customer relationships, which had estimated\nremaining useful lives of 5and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n92\nTable of Contents\n5.

The fair value of the Company’s Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from\nindependent pricing services, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments in less\nactive markets or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2025 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term.\nIn June 2024, the Company ceased use of and made available for sublease certain corporate office spaces. As a\nresult, the Company determined that the asset groups, which primarily consist of the related operating lease right-\nof-use assets and leasehold improvements, were impaired, and recognized an impairment charge of $ 83million\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024. The fair value of the\nasset groups was estimated using an income-approach based on estimated future cash flows expected to be derived\nfrom the office spaces based on current sublease market rent. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was continuing\nits efforts to sublease the spaces.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022       2023       2024\nOperating lease costs     $                       81    $   108    $   103\nShort-term lease costs                             9         12         16\nSublease income                                   -4         -3         -2\nTotal lease costs         $                       86    $   117    $   117\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2023            2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            7.76            7.45\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  6.60%           6.79%\n97\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022       2023       2024\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       75    $   113    $   116\nleases\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                      154    $    85    $    81\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 66million and $ 6million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices,\nthe classification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with consumer protection\nlaws, privacy, cybersecurity, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. For example, the Company is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of\nCalifornia (the “CA EDD”) for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain\namounts that it found to be owed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent\ncontractors. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse\nassessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is uncertain and, accordingly, the Company has recorded\nan accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets\nas of December 31, 2024. The results of investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries and related governmental\naction are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, demand, or\ninquiry having a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n98\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company's technology. The terms of\nthese indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement.\nIn addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers of the Company, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct\nof the individual.\nThe maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements. Noliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of data processing and\ntechnology platform infrastructure. These purchase commitments are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheet as of December 31, 2024 as the Company has not yet received the related services. As of December 31,\n2024, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-cancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2025                                   316\n2026                                   372\n2027                                   285\n2028                                    87\n2029                                     8\nTotal future minimum payments    $   1,068\nInsurance Collateral\nThe Company is required to maintain $ 692million in collateral in connection with certain insurance policies, which\ncan be held in a combination of cash, surety bonds, and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had\n$ 692million of collateral outstanding in the form of surety bonds and letters of credit in connection with the\ninsurance collateral requirement.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement, which, as most recently\namended and restated on April 26, 2024, provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $ 800million,\nwith a letter of credit sublimit of $ 600million, maturing on April 26, 2029. Loans under the revolving credit\nfacility bear interest at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nSOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of\none, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees\nfor a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused\ncommitment fee of 0.10%. The Company's obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of\nits domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the credit agreement. The credit agreement\ncontains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants that\n99\nTable of Contents\nrestrict the Company's ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness,\ngrant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or consolidate\nwith other companies or sell substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,\nmake investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also maintain\ncompliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2023 and 2024, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nIn addition to the letters of credit maintained in connection with the insurance collateral requirement, the\nCompany also maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company had $ 138million and $ 141million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 115million and $ 112million, respectively, were issued from the revolving credit and\nguaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities as they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Company is under audit by various state, local, and foreign tax authorities with regard to\nsales and indirect tax matters. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and\nthe amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from\nthe amounts accrued.\n10. Common Stock\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, the Company authorized the repurchase of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $\n1.1billion. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.1million shares of its Class A\ncommon stock at a weighted average price of $ 105.12per share for a total amount of $ 224million. The shares were\nretired immediately upon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the Wolt acquisition.\nVesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment at the Company during the\nrequisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance date. The fair value of the\nrestricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is recorded as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of                    Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares                 Grant Date\n31, 2023                                          285       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                             —    $                     —\nVested                                           -193    $                 76.91\nForfeited                                           —    $                     —\nUnvested restricted stock as of December           92\n31, 2024\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\n100\nTable of Contents\nStock options issued and outstanding       December 31, 2023    December 31, 2024\nunder the 2014 Plan and Inducement Plan                9,022                4,516\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 Plan,                 37,822               29,566\n2020 Plan and Inducement Plan\nRemaining shares available for future                 50,137               64,481\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                103,480              105,062\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vested over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapsed over time as the shares vested at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of\nshares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014\nPlan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to\nthe terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO registration statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the\nCompany's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are\nforfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on\nJanuary 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total\nnumber of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each\nautomatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to\nthe applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\n2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “Inducement\nPlan”), pursuant to which the Company reserved 9,760,000shares of Class A common stock to be used exclusively for\ngrants of equity-based awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, as a\nmaterial inducement to the individual’s entry into employment with the Company. The Inducement Plan permits the\ngrant\n101\nTable of Contents\nof nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance\nshares. Shares that actually have been issued under the Inducement Plan under any award will not be returned to the\nInducement Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Inducement Plan; however, if shares\nissued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares or performance units are repurchased by the\nCompany or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such shares will become available for future grant\nunder the Inducement Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholding\nobligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the Inducement Plan. The\nexercise price, term, and any other terms and conditions of the options granted under the Inducement Plan will be\ndetermined by the administrator of the plan.\nRSUs\nThe Company generally grants RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition, which\nis generally four years. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the Company’s\nIPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches that are\neligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share, each of\nwhich are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day calendar period during\nthe performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if the\nCompany achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recorded $ 112million, $ 104million, and $ 67million of stock-based compensation expense related to the\nCEO Performance Award during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. As of December 31,\n2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 7million, which is\nexpected to be recognized over the remaining period of 0.32years.\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 Plan, 2020 Plan, and Inducement Plan was as follows (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2023                      9,022    $       4.38                 3.41    $        853\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                           -4,504    $       3.04                         $        580\nCancelled and forfeited                                 -2    $       2.63\nBalance as of December 31, 2024                      4,516    $       5.72                 3.18    $        732\nExercisable as of December 31, 2024                  4,300    $       5.79                 3.24    $        696\nVested and expected to vest as of                    4,516    $       5.72                 3.18    $        732\nDecember 31, 2024\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market as of\nthe respective year-end dates.

The weighted-average fair\nvalue per share of RSUs granted and assumed via acquisition during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and\n2024 was $ 74.16, $ 65.06, and $ 128.17, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company estimated the fair value of stock options assumed via acquisition using the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model. Key assumptions of the Black-Scholes valuation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected\nvolatility, expected term and expected dividends. The Company determined the expected term of assumed in the money\noption awards by considering vesting provisions, the expected exercise behavior, and contractual term of the\nawards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in\nduration to the expected term of the stock option awards. The Company developed the expected volatility using the\naverage volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of similar publicly traded peer\ncompanies. The Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on\nits common stock.\n103\nTable of Contents\nThere were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, except for the\noptions assumed via acquisition in 2022.

Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 257million, $ 203million, and $ 494million in the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1.8billion and $ 1.7billion, respectively. Federal net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. Of the $\n1.7billion of state net operating losses, $ 559million carry forward indefinitely. The remaining state net\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had foreign net\noperating loss carryforwards of $ 1.7billion that begin to expire in 2025.\nThe Company also had $ 417million and $ 213million of federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The federal research and development tax credits expire in\nvarying amounts starting in 2041. The California research credits do not expire and carry forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a\ncurrent limitation on the tax attributes under Section 382 and 383.\nThe Company intends to invest substantially all of its foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as its capital in its\nforeign subsidiaries, indefinitely in those jurisdictions in which the Company could incur significant, additional\ncosts upon repatriation of such amounts.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022       2023       2024\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                       69    $    69    $   183\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                               19         47         64\npositions\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                  —         67         28\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                -19          —          —\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                       69    $   183    $   275\nThe Company had $ 275million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, the majority of which\nwould not impact its effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does\nnot anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at December 31, 2024\nwill significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, which were not material for the periods presented.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which the Company operates include the United States and Finland. The Company’s 2013 and\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s 2018 and\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination in Finland.\n12. Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders using the two-\nclass method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than\nvoting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net\nincome and losses. The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 does not assume the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock because including\nsuch shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders during the periods presented. RSUs that vested but have not been settled are\nincluded in the denominator in calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\n105\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022                        2023                        2024\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nBasic net income\n(loss) per share\nNumerator\nNet income\n(loss) including\nredeemable          $              -1,260    $     -108    $     -525    $      -40    $      109    $        8\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nLess: Net loss\nattributable to\nredeemable                             -3             —            -7             —            -6             —\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nNet income\n(loss)\nattributable to                    -1,257          -108          -518           -40           115             8\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nDenominator\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute basic\nnet\nincome (loss)                     342,015        29,398       365,340        27,608       384,692        26,859\nper share\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nBasic net income\n(loss) per share\nattributable to     $               -3.68    $    -3.68    $    -1.42    $    -1.42    $     0.30    $     0.30\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022                        2023                        2024\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nDiluted net\nincome (loss)\nper share\nNumerator\nNet income\n(loss)\nattributable to     $              -1,257    $     -108    $     -518    $      -40    $      115    $        8\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nDenominator\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute basic\nnet\nincome (loss)                     342,015        29,398       365,340        27,608       384,692        26,859\nper share\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nWeighted-average\neffect of\npotentially                             —             —             —             —        18,691             —\ndilutive\nsecurities\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute\ndiluted net\nincome (loss)                     342,015        29,398       365,340        27,608       403,383        26,859\nper share\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nDiluted net\nincome (loss)\nper share\nattributable to     $               -3.68    $    -3.68    $    -1.42    $    -1.42    $     0.29    $     0.29\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet income (loss) per share because including such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such\nshares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the\nrespective periods (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022      2023      2024\nStock options to purchase common stock                       16,021     9,022         —\nUnvested restricted stock and restricted                     45,172    38,072    10,801\nstock units\nEscrow shares                                                 2,012        72        72\nTotal                                                        63,205    47,166    10,873\n13. Employee Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. In 2023, the Company began to make\ndiscretionary matching contributions to those participating employees who met certain employment criteria. The\nCompany's matching contributions to the plan were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2024.\n106\nTable of Contents\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEmployees based in Finland are covered under the Finnish Employees’ Pension Act (“TyEL”). TyEL is a statutory\nprivate sector pension act that is partly funded and paid through a pay-as-you-go pool. The Old-age Pension and\nDisability Pension benefits of TyEL are classified as postretirement benefits under defined benefit plan accounting\nstandards and based on an actuarial valuation. The Old-age Pension liability for active employees includes the\neffect of future salary increases. The Disability Pension liability for active employees is based on employees'\ntotal salary two years before the fiscal year.\nNet periodic benefit cost is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Service cost is\nreflected in total costs and expenses. Other components of net periodic benefit cost, including interest cost and\namortization of actuarial gains and losses, is included in other expense, net. Actuarial gains and losses resulting\nfrom remeasurement are initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\n14. Variable Interest Entities\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company formed a joint venture with a retail partner in Canada with the objective of providing\non-demand delivery of grocery and convenience items to customers in Canada (the \"JV\"). The Company owns a majority\ninterest in the JV.\nIn connection with the formation of the JV, the Company had committed to contribute cash and certain assets worth $\n98million Canadian dollars (approximately $ 73million US dollars) over three years. Upon the closing of the\ntransaction, the Company contributed cash and certain assets of $ 41million Canadian dollars (approximately $\n32million US dollars). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company contributed cash of $ 18million\nCanadian dollars (approximately $ 13million US dollars). Additional capital contributions will be made in a manner\nthat preserves the ownership percentage of each shareholder.\nThe common units held by the Company in the JV were determined to be a variable interest. The Company is the\nprimary beneficiary because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\nperformance of the JV. As a result, the Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the JV.\nTotal assets of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $ 39million\nand $ 32million, respectively. Total liabilities of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024 were $ 11million and $ 8million, respectively.\nThe JV’s assets may only be used to settle the JV’s obligations and may not be used for other consolidated\nentities. The JV’s liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of the Company’s other consolidated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the minority shareholder’s ownership in the JV is classified as redeemable non-\ncontrolling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the Company’s control. The\nredeemable non-controlling interest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that\nthe non-controlling interest will become redeemable. Total redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 7million and $\n7million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling\ninterest was $ 3million, $ 7million and $ 6million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively.\n15. Segment Reporting\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.

Subsequent Events\nIn February 2025, the Company announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of\nshares of its Class A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $ 5.0billion, which is inclusive of the\nremaining share repurchase authority of $ 876million under the share repurchase program that was previously\nannounced by the Company in February 2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases\nor through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other\nrelevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule\n10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate\nrepurchases of its Class A common stock under this authorization. The Company may or may not repurchase any portion\nof the total authorized amount, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of\nfactors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\n108\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\n(“certifying officers”), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our board\nof directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n109\nTable of Contents"
