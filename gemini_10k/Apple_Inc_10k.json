The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During\n2020, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%,\nrespectively, of total net sales.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it\ndesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include\nprice, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and\nservice quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem,\nmarketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets\nand other electronic devices and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\nhardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors\nhave broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has\nbeen particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain\ncompetitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or\neven at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use\nillegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition in these\nmarkets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within\ntheir products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently\noffer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks,\ntrade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the\nCompany believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that\nits success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and\ndesign, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has\naccumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company\nalso holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its\nintellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nEmployees\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had approximately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other\ninformation filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-\nrelations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically\nprovides other information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations\nwebsite, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance,\ninformation on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important\nto understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with\nPart II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors,\nwhether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which\ncould, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary\nmaterially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors,\nin whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating\nresults and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and\ncould in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly\ncurtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing,\nsupply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply\nshortages that affected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic, the Company’s retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and\npoints of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and\nsafety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work\nremotely.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the\nrecommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nthe Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside\nthe Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic,\nthe development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with\nprotective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects\non: demand for the Company’s products and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels;\nthe Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and growth.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities,\nare located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global\nand regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and\nservices. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market\nvolatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or\nasset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\nor regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products;\nand insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s\ntrade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and growth.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it\ndesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in\nR&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be\nable to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection may not be\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to\ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no\nassurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to\nthese new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the\nCompany’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in\nline with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs\nto meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or\ndeficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service\nintroductions and transitions.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many\nof whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-\nparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies\nfor users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same\namounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with\nnew carriers.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered\ninto agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to\nextend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial\nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry,\nfurther limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable\nterms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and\nregional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and growth, ” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore,\nthe Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially\nadversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing\npartner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be\nmaterially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to\nidentify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or\nquantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company\ngenerally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product\ndefects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to\nadhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to,\nnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions,\neconomic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component\ndefects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal\ninjury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including\nhealthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may\nnot meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and\nperformance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to\nproduct liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant\nand equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs\nand regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products\nand services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost\nsales.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third\nparties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for\nthe Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or\ndistributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be\nunable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage\nrules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content\navailable, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact\non the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt\nlegislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the\nprotection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s\ncontent providers.\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the\nmarket position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future\ngrowth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices may suffer.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications\nmight not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly\nand may result in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast\nmajority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only\nretains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers\npurchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the\nCompany’s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company\nearns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is\nreduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties,\nwhich requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries\nin which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the\nrapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing\npatents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be\ninfringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry\npractice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or\nto use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results.\nThe Company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal\nproceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in\nthese actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to\nmanagement. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to\nsettle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on\nacceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s\ncost of sales and operating expenses.\nExcept as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note\n10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not\nat least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to\ninfringement of intellectual property rights.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary\ndamages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company,\nand could require the Company to change its business practices or limit the Company’s ability to offer certain\nproducts and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating\nresults.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but\nnot limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\nbilling and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms;\nInternet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability\nof third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade;\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and\ninvestment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the\nCompany’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers,\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products\nand services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees,\ncontractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the\nCompany is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nreputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For\nexample, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can\nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted,\nlegislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the Company’s\nbusiness, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings, limiting the Company’s\nability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or affecting the Company’s business relationships with other\ntechnology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults. Further, the Company’s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against\nthem, could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will\nnot be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations,\nlitigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for\nretail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\ninvestment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the\nCompany’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple\nstores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance\ncosts.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an\nadverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to:\nmanage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail\npartners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases\nin quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be\nsuccessful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural\ndisasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses,\nphysical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures\nmay be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by,\namong other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or\nimpeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally\nidentifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and\noperational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things,\npersonally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company\ndevotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other\nsecurity measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security,\nand losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such\nmeasures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information\noccur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nFor example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems\nthat compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident\ncould, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and\nservices, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to\nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its\nhigh profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication\ntechnologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be\nvulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\nirregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names,\npasswords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information\ntechnology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in\nthe delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nIn addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject\nto specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional\nprivacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental\nauthorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply\nwith these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government\ninvestigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or\nfines.\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could\nbe liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails\nto follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase\nin payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card\nindustry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may\nrestrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed\nlaws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to\ndevelop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\ninternational requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided\non its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with\nother federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in\nproceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties\ncould include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including\nits Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the\ntechnology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial\naccidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in\ninternational trade. International trade disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that\nrestrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the\nU.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as\nother business restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw\nmaterials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns\non its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the\nCompany’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as\ncontrols on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations\nand supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and\nstop offering third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new\nor changed trade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and\ndistracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may\nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding\ninternational trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes,\npublic health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s\ncontrol. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with\nmore intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\nproducts to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the\nCompany could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose\nsignificant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many\ncritical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to\nthe Company.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s\nreputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected,\nand could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for\nconsumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel\nrestrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in\nthe Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current\nproducts and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s\nservices; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of\nproducts and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and\nthe introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These\nand other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme\nstock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these\ncompanies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock\nprice should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price\nshould reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current\nshare repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number\nof shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\nrepurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material\nadverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products\nin foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nand incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market\nand economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result,\nthe value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may\nfluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\nresellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\nand government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by\ncollateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of\nthe Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The\nCompany’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international\nmarkets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade\nreceivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-\nassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated\nwith long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few\nindividual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to\ncredit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no\nassurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation\nor exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various\njurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes\nin the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in\nthe U.S. and Ireland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount\nin excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected."

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and\n2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year\ncomparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nCOVID-19 Update\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly\ncurtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice.\nDuring 2020, aspects of the Company’s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the\nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the\nvast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and the\nmajority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety\nof employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail\nstores, subject to local rules and regulations.\nThe full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial\nperformance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including,\nwithout limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability\nof effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the\npandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under\nthe heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with\ncommercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital\nneeds, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements\nassociated with its existing operations.\nFiscal 2020 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of\nServices and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net\nsales during 2020.\nIn April 2020, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $175\nbillion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020.\nDuring 2020, the Company repurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents\nof $14.1 billion.\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\n2020.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a\ndifferent Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be\nsubject to volatility and remain under downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2020       Change            2019       Change            2018\nResearch and development               $  18,752           16  %    $  16,217           14  %    $  14,236\nPercentage of total net sales                  7  %                         6  %                         5  %\nSelling, general and administrative    $  19,916            9  %    $  18,245            9  %    $  16,705\nPercentage of total net sales                  7  %                         7  %                         6  %\nTotal operating expenses               $  38,668           12  %    $  34,462           11  %    $  30,941\nPercentage of total net sales                 14  %                        13  %                        12  %\nResearch and Development\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nThe Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive\nposition in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to\nthe Company’s core business strategy.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases\nin headcount-related expenses, higher spending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 23\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions):\n2020    Change            2019    Change            2018\nInterest and dividend income         $   3,763                 $   4,961                 $   5,686\nInterest expense                        -2,873                    -3,576                    -3,240\nOther income/(expense), net                -87                       422                      -441\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $     803       -56  %    $   1,807       -10  %    $   2,005\nThe year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2020 was due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain\nactivity on non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense. The weighted-average interest\nrate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.85% and 2.19% in 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were\nas follows (dollars in millions):\n2020            2019            2018\nProvision for income taxes           $  9,680       $  10,481       $  13,372\nEffective tax rate                       14.4  %         15.9  %         18.3  %\nStatutory federal income tax rate          21  %           21  %         24.5  %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due\nprimarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from\nshare-based compensation.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower compared to 2019 due primarily to a one-time adjustment of U.S.\nforeign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 in\nconnection with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) and higher tax benefits from share-based\ncompensation.\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and\ntax credits of $11.0 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 billion. Management believes it is more likely\nthan not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning\nstrategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover\nthe net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any,\nby assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”),\nwhich modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt\nASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the\ncomposition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity,\nthe adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 24\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September\n26, 2020, September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions):\n2020          2019          2018\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable     $  191,830    $  205,898    $  237,100\nsecurities(1)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net        $   36,766    $   37,378    $   41,304\nCommercial paper                          $    4,996    $    5,980    $   11,964\nTotal term debt                           $  107,440    $  102,067    $  102,519\nWorking capital                           $   38,321    $   57,101    $   15,410\nCash generated by operating activities    $   80,674    $   69,391    $   77,434\nCash generated by/(used in) investing     $   -4,289    $   45,896    $   16,066\nactivities\nCash used in financing activities         $  -86,820    $  -90,976    $  -87,876\n(1) As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $18.6 billion and $18.9\nbillion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5,\n“Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and other\nagreements.\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with\ncommercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital\nneeds, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements\nassociated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\nIn connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion\nplus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the\nconclusion of all legal proceedings. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”\nThe Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the\nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally\nrequires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.\nDuring 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion was a result of $57.4 billion of net income,\nnon-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and\nliabilities of $5.7 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $4.3 billion during 2020 consisted primarily of\ncash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of\ncash acquired, of $1.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities,\nnet of purchases, of $5.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $86.8 billion during 2020 consisted\nprimarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.4 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend\nequivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay or redeem term debt of $12.6 billion and net repayments of\ncommercial paper of $1.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $16.1 billion.\nDuring 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $69.4 billion was a result of $55.3 billion of net income\nand non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in\noperating assets and liabilities of $3.5 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during\n2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5\nbillion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion. Cash used in\nfinancing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of\n$66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt\nof $8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the\nissuance of term debt of $7.0 billion.\nDebt\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes,\nincluding dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $5.0 billion of Commercial\nPaper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months.\nThe Company may enter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the\nsecurities at a specified time and amount as an additional short-term liquidity arrangement.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 25\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\naggregate principal amount of $106.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2020, the Company issued $16.1\nbillion and repaid or redeemed $12.6 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into\ninterest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes.

The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not\nexceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual obligations table\nincludes future payments under leases that had commenced as of September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on\nthe Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of\nSeptember 26, 2020. Further information regarding the Company’s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.”\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build\nproduct based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The\nCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including\nproduct tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising,\nlicensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 26, 2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the\ndeemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nThe Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to\nmake a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included\nin the above contractual obligations table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may\ndiffer from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\nManagement believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue\nrecognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation\nfees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical\nbecause they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and\nthey require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior\nmanagement has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the\nsale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the\nsubstantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of\nsale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which\ninclude iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations,\nthe allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related\nbundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nThe Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors\nthat may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should\nfuture facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-\nrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could\nchange. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified\nsoftware upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nValuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\nThe Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and\nprepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of\ninventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders\nthat have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s estimates of future product development plans\nand demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and\nassessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial\ndecline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product\ndevelopment plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the\nCompany may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase\ncommitment cancellation fees.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27\nWarranty Costs\nThe Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to\nrepair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the\nCompany’s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue\nis recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and\nknowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical experience. If actual product failure rates or\nrepair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest\nbenefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax\nliabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and\ncomplex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could\nhave a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the\nCompany is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably\nestimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the\nheading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company\nmay have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company\nin a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the\neffective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures\nand, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and\noutstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income\nand expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the\ninterest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those\nsecurities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment\npolicy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based\non investment positions as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28\nAs of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with\nvarying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding\nterm debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate\npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by\nthe corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest\nrates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to\nincrease by $218 million and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect\nagainst foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12\nmonths. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures.\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess\nthe potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation\nto generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company\nestimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020,\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions\nmay differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2020 due to the inherent\nlimitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 29"

Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries\n(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the\nopinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are\nnormal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results\ncould differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s\nfiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September\nand the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nCommon Stock Split\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\n2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted\nto reflect the stock split.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nLeases\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the\n“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs\nissued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies\nlease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities\nfor operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases\nstandard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented\nwere not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether\nany are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company\nrecorded $ 7.5billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $ 8.1billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nHedging\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging\n(Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands\ncomponent and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the\nseparate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to\nhedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the\nCompany recorded a $ 136million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a\ncorresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will\nultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net\nincome in millions and shares in thousands):\nNumerator:                                  2020             2019             2018\nNet income                         $      57,411    $      55,256    $      59,531\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares         17,352,119       18,471,336       19,821,510\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities            176,095          124,315          178,925\nWeighted-average diluted shares       17,528,214       18,595,651       20,000,435\nBasic earnings per share           $        3.31    $        2.99    $        3.00\nDiluted earnings per share         $        3.28    $        2.97    $        2.98\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities.Potentially dilutive securities representing 62million shares of common stock were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-\nsale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\ninstrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities\nclassified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and\ntheir availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair\nvalue with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40years or the remaining life of the building; between\noneand five yearsfor machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and\nthe shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use\nsoftware are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\nthreeto seven years.Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 9.7billion, $ 11.3billion\nand $ 9.3billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNon-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to\naccounts payable and other current liabilities of $( 2.9) billion and $ 3.4billion during 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 37\nNon-Marketable Securities\nThe Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair\nvalues. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are\nadjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of\nthe same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally\nrestricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines\ncurrent or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports\nrestricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nbased on the classification of the underlying securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the\nCompany’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high\ncredit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis,\nfuture unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates\nrevenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on\nthe Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when\ncontrol has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to\nthe product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these\nundelivered services.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to,\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store\nand certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a\nnet basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\nauthorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority.\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 10.2billion and $\n8.1billion, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):\n2020          2019          2018\niPhone(1)

the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, digital content and other services.\nServices net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and Apple\nTV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products.\n(4) Includes $ 5.0billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28,\n2019, $ 5.9billion of revenue recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018,\nand $ 5.8billion of revenue recognized in 2018 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2017.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each

$\n18.9billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note\n5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 40\nThe Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of\nthe Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from oneto five years.\nThe Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential\nrisk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in\nthe investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the\nCompany reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its\ncost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether\nit will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-\ntemporarily impaired.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nThe Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable\nfair values. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a\ncarrying value of $ 2.8billion and $ 2.9billion, respectively.\nRestricted Cash\nA reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 26, 2020 and September\n28, 2019 is as follows (in millions):\n2020         2019\nCash and cash equivalents                $  38,016    $  48,844\nRestricted cash included in other               36           23\ncurrent assets\nRestricted cash included in other            1,737        1,357\nnon-current assets\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted    $  39,789    $  50,224\ncash\nThe Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate\nrisk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets\nand liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including,\nbut not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nThere can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency\nrevenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted\ninventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash\nflow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with\nrevenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the\nCompany may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the\ncarrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the\nCompany may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of\nits net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or\nchanges in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions\nare expected to be recognized within 22years.\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-functional currencies.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 41\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\ninterest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may\noffset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates\nthese instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest\nrate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.\nCash Flow Hedges\nCash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the\nhedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign\ncurrency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is\nrecognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a\ncomponent of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses\nassociated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the\nrelated income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded\nfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge\nrelates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-\nmonth time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified\ninto OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are\nreflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\nNet Investment Hedges\nNet investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment\nhedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on\na straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nFair Value Hedges\nFair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in\nthe same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as\nfair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge.Amounts excluded from the effectiveness\nassessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 465million and $ 777million for 2020 and\n2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in OCI.\nNon-Designated Derivatives\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\nThe Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting\ntreatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the\nCompany’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions):\n2020\nFair Value of                    Fair Value

Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk\namounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are\noutstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on\nthen-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market\nrisk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and\ncredit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated\nwith the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized\nupon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,\nwill depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 44\nThe Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\npermitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company\ngenerally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when\nthe net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The\nCompany presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company\nrelated to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 875million and $ 1.6billion,\nrespectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current\nliabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\nUnder master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the\nCompany is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the\nCompany’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities of $ 2.8billion and $ 2.7billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities\nof $ 312million and $ 407million, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had nocustomers that individually represented 10%\nor more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 51% of total trade\nreceivables as of September 28, 2019.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57% and 11%. As of\nSeptember 28, 2019, the Company had twovendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade\nreceivables, which accounted for 59% and 14%.\nNote 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 26, 2020 and\nSeptember 28, 2019 (in millions):\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n2020          2019\nLand and buildings                          $   17,952    $   17,085\nMachinery, equipment and internal-use           75,291        69,797\nsoftware\nLeasehold improvements                          10,283         9,075\nGross property, plant and equipment            103,526        95,957\nAccumulated depreciation and                   -66,760       -58,579\namortization\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net    $   36,766    $   37,378\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n2020         2019\nLong-term taxes payable                $  28,170    $  29,545\nOther non-current liabilities             26,320       20,958\nTotal other non-current liabilities    $  54,490    $  50,503\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 45\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of OI&E for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\n2020         2019         2018\nInterest and dividend income         $   3,763    $   4,961    $   5,686\nInterest expense                        -2,873       -3,576       -3,240\nOther income/(expense), net                -87          422         -441\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $     803    $   1,807    $   2,005\nNote 5 – Income Taxes\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax\nlaw. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1,\n2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through\n2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign\njurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate\nprovision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax\naudits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a\nmanner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes\nin the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain,\nthe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next\n12 months by as much as $ 3.9billion.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47\nInterest and Penalties\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.As\nof September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $\n1.4billion and $ 1.3billion, respectively.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.9billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The 2014 Plan\nprovides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of\nRSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus\nawards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are\nsettled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014\nPlan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs\ngranted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares\navailable for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs canceled or shares\nwithheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle\nholders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same\nvesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the\nunderlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 1.54billion shares plus the number of\nshares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under\nthe 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding\nobligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020,\napproximately 808million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.\nApple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i)\npermits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides\nfor automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic\nannual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to\nprospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award\ngrants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these\ngrants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval.\nRSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of\ntwotimes the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the\ncorresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26,\n2020, approximately 4million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 51\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L.

An employee’s\npayroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not\npurchase more than $ 25,000of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 107million\nshares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under\nthe 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual\ncontribution limit ($ 19,500for calendar year 2020).

The majority of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net share settled\nsuch that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable\nincome and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 56million, 59million and 64million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice.

The Company\naccounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value\nof such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 53\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and\ncontent creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in\nexcess of one year as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):\n2021          $  3,476\n2022             2,885\n2023             1,700\n2024               357\n2025               104\nThereafter         130\nTotal         $  8,652\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal\nmatters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have\nincurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for\nasserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products\ninfringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded\ndamages of $ 503million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,\nwhich remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled\nfor a re-trial in October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at\nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further\nappeal by VirnetX.\niOS Performance Management Cases\nVarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various\ninternational jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other\ncauses of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems,\nintroduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-\nmonetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict\nLitigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a\nsettlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which\nthe Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $\n500million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of\nthe settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee\naward. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310million to settle the claims. In addition to civil\nlitigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to\nthe performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the\nperformance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve\ncustomers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any\nmaterial information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.\nFrench Competition Authority\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s\nsales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1billion. The\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 54\nOptis\nOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents\nowned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $\n506million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending.\nNote 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.”\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs\nexcluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development,\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges\nand other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes.\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\nAmericas:                      2020          2019          2018\nNet sales                $  124,556    $  116,914    $  112,093\nOperating income         $   37,722    $   35,099    $   34,864\nEurope:\nNet sales                $   68,640    $   60,288    $   62,420\nOperating income         $   22,170    $   19,195    $   19,955\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $   40,308    $   43,678    $   51,942\nOperating income         $   15,261    $   16,232    $   19,742\nJapan:\nNet sales                $   21,418    $   21,506    $   21,733\nOperating income         $    9,279    $    9,369    $    9,500\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $   19,593    $   17,788    $   17,407\nOperating income         $    6,808    $    6,055    $    6,181\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 55\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020,\n2019 and 2018 is as follows (in millions):\n2020          2019          2018\nSegment operating income            $   91,240    $   85,950    $   90,242\nResearch and development expense       -18,752       -16,217       -14,236\nOther corporate expenses, net           -6,200        -5,803        -5,108\nTotal operating income              $   66,288    $   63,930    $   70,898\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2020,\n2019 and 2018. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNet sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and long-lived assets as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as\nfollows (in millions):\nNet sales:               2020          2019          2018\nU.S.               $  109,197    $  102,266    $   98,061\nChina(1)               40,308        43,678        51,942\nOther countries       125,010       114,230       115,592\nTotal net sales    $  274,515    $  260,174    $  265,595\nLong-lived assets:              2020         2019\nU.S.                       $  25,890    $  24,711\nChina(1)                       7,256        9,064\nOther countries                3,620        3,603\nTotal long-lived assets    $  36,766    $  37,378\n(1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Long-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling\nand manufacturing process equipment and assets related to retail stores and related infrastructure.\nNote 12 – Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing\nand data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10years and generally contain\nmulti-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may\ncontain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily\nbased on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the\nCompany’s operating leases were $ 1.5billion for 2020. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the\nCompany’s leases were $ 9.3billion for 2020. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former\nlease accounting standards, was $ 1.3billion and $ 1.2billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFor 2020, the Company made $ 1.5billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities\ninvolving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 10.5billion for 2020, including the impact\nof adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 56\nThe following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as\nof September 26, 2020 (in millions):\nLease-Related Assets and Liabilities    Financial Statement Line\nRight-of-use assets:                    Items                                     2020\nOperating leases                        Other non-current assets              $  8,570\nFinance leases                          Property, plant and equipment, net         629\nTotal right-of-use assets                                                     $  9,199\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases                        Other current liabilities             $  1,436\nOther non-current liabilities            7,745\nFinance leases                          Other current liabilities                   24\nOther non-current liabilities              637\nTotal lease liabilities                                                       $  9,842\nLease liability maturities as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):\nOperating       Finance\nLeases        Leases        Total\n2021                              $      1,493    $       43    $   1,536\n2022                                     1,461            43        1,504\n2023                                     1,317            54        1,371\n2024                                     1,068            30        1,098\n2025                                       960            25          985\nThereafter                               3,845           895        4,740\nTotal undiscounted liabilities          10,144         1,090       11,234\nLess: Imputed interest                    -963          -429       -1,392\nTotal lease liabilities           $      9,181    $      661    $   9,842\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of\nSeptember 26, 2020 were 10.3years and 2.0%, respectively. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of\nthe Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily\ndetermined.\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had $ 1.7billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for\ncorporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses\nDescription of the Matter    significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the\nimpact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax\nlaws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 59\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe  sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 29, 2020\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 60\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 29, 2020\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61"

                "content": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting."

Business\nCompany Background\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories,\nand sells a variety of related services. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the\nlast Saturday of September.\nProducts\niPhone\niPhone ® is the Company’s line of smartphones based on its iOS operating system.

Apple Watch is the Company’s line of smart watches based on its watchOS ®\noperating system. In September 2021, the Company announced Apple Watch Series 7, which was available starting in\nOctober 2021.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 1\nServices\nAdvertising\nThe Company’s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company’s own\nadvertising platforms.\nAppleCare\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare ® brand. The offerings\nprovide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for\nrepair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or\ntheft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple\ndevices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store ® , that allow customers to discover and download\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade ® , a game\nsubscription service; Apple Music ® , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio\nstations; Apple News+ ® , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ SM , which offers exclusive\noriginal content. During 2021, the Company released Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a\ncashless payment service.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During\n2021, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 36% and 64%,\nrespectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks,\ntrade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the\nCompany believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that\nits success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and\ndesign, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has\naccumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company\nalso holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its\nintellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the\ndevelopment of all of its team members and to continuously building on its strong culture. As of September 25,\n2021, the Company had approximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color,\nreligion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, caste or other\nlegally protected characteristic. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and\ndiversity.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable\nemployees to share in the Company’s success as shareholders of the Company. The Company recognizes its people are\nmost likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees\naround the world.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in tools and resources that support employees’ individual growth and development. The Company\nalso provides classes and seminars to foster understanding and critical thinking about the Company’s culture,\norganization and values.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to hiring inclusively, providing training and development opportunities, fostering an\ninclusive culture, and ensuring equitable pay for employees, and is continuing to focus on increasing diverse\nrepresentation at every level of the Company.\nThe Company has initiatives in place to implement its commitment to increase diverse representation, including\ncreating diverse interview panels and candidate slates, focusing on robust diversity recruiting efforts, and\nexpanding diversity outreach efforts through organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented\ncommunities. The Company also offers team members access to ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support\nthroughout their career journey and helps them find community and connection through employee groups that create\nspaces for belonging, learning, and growing inclusivity, diversity and equity efforts.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leadership fosters an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can participate, develop and thrive. Team members are\nencouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company regularly conducts\nsurveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential risks\nassociated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company\nsupports employees with general safety training and puts specific programs in place for those working in\npotentially high-hazard environments, including chemical management, laser safety, equipment and machinery safety,\nhazardous materials management and electrical safety. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19\npandemic, including providing information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and\ncase support. The Company also offers special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as\ncomprehensive health coverage.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 4\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the\nCompany’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those\ndescribed below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Such measures have included restrictions on travel and\nbusiness operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\ndisruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well\nas the price of the Company’s stock. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component\nsuppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply\nshortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. The Company’s retail\nstores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, as\nstores and points of sale have reopened, they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and\nthe health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its\nemployees to work remotely.\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations\nand requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s\noperational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s\ncontrol, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the\ndevelopment, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective\npublic safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.\nAdditional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand\nfor the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the\nCompany’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and\nservices. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market\nvolatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or\nasset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products;\nand insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s\ntrade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\nindustrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in\ninternational trade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures\nthat restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between\nthe U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as\nwell as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw\nmaterials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns\non its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the\nCompany’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as\ncontrols on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations\nand supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance\nwith new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and\ndistracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may\nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\npandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\nnatural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies\nin the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s\nreputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected,\nand could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for\nconsumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel\nrestrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in\nthe Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current\nproducts and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to\nthese new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage\nthe risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s\nproducts, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product\ndemand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand,\nand the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no\nassurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have\nan adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain\nprovisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for\nwarranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product\ndefect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of\nconduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business,\nlabor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar\nterms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure\nfor the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the\nCompany’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component\ndefects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal\ninjury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including\nhealthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as\nanticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect\nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in\nwidespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company\ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of\ninventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses,\nincluding litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\nintroductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a\ncommission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to\ntime, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and\nlegal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as\nthe proposed European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. The Company is\nalso subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the\nCompany’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and\nto what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside\nof the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales,\nwould decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is\notherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19\npandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees,\nincluding key personnel.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including\nits Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the\ntechnology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive\nculture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture, it\ncould adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many\nof whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-\nparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network\ndisruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of\nterrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents,\nor other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate,\nand the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things,\npreventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the\nmanufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious\nattacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the price of the Company’s stock, materially\ndamage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could\nresult in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue\naccelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are\ndesigned to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders\nthe Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other\nsensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems\nand services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like\nmultifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under\nsuspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede\ncustomer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for\nretail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\ninvestment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the\nCompany’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple\nstores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance\ncosts.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in\nthese actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to\nmanagement. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to\nsettle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on\nacceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s\ncost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the\nCompany’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item\n8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies”\nunder the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility\nthe Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled\nmonetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the\nCompany, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer\ncertain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet,\ntelecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-\nparty software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax;\nand environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the\nCompany’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers,\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products\nand services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors\nor agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is\nfound to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not\nbe able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\ncompetition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New\nlegislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes.\nThese changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and\nmanages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\nsignificant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject\nto litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may\nin the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely\naffect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from\nlicensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and\ncertain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-\nparty transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering\nimposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be\ninconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data is subject to additional\nprivacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental\nauthorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply\nwith these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government\ninvestigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or\nfines.\nFinancial data, such as payment card data, is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and\nobligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated\ninvestigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card\nindustry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card\ntransaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data\nsecurity standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s\nservices; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of\nproducts and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory\nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\nand the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures.\nThese and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products\nin foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nand incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-\nmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant\nlosses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their\nvalue could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\nresellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\nand government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by\ncollateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of\nthe Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The\nCompany’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international\nmarkets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade\nreceivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated\nwith long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few\nindividual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to\ncredit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no\nassurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for\nincome taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The\nCompany’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory\ntax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount\nin excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 16\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention."

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and\n2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year\ncomparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments\nand businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global\nfinancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and\ncould in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as\nwell as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the\nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a\nsignificant number of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores\nand substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the\nhealth and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its\nfacilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s\ncomponent suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that\naffected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance\nis uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent,\ntrajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution\nand effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact\nof the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K\nunder the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.\nFiscal 2021 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 33% or $91.3 billion during 2021 compared to 2020, driven by growth in all Products and\nServices categories. Year-over-year net sales during 2021 also grew in each of the Company’s reportable segments.\nIn April 2021, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $225\nbillion to $315 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.205 to $0.22 per share beginning in May 2021.\nDuring 2021, the Company repurchased $85.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents\nof $14.5 billion.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 20\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nNet sales by category:                         2021    Change             2020    Change             2019\niPhone(1)                                $  191,973        39  %    $  137,781        -3  %    $  142,381\nMac(1)                                       35,190        23  %        28,622        11  %        25,740\niPad(1)                                      31,862        34  %        23,724        11  %        21,280\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)        38,367        25  %        30,620        25  %        24,482\nServices(3)                                  68,425        27  %        53,768        16  %        46,291\nTotal net sales                          $  365,817        33  %    $  274,515         6  %    $  260,174\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod, iPod touch and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and\nother services.

The movement of foreign currencies in Europe relative to the U.S. dollar had a net favorable impact on Europe\nnet sales during 2021.\nGreater China\nGreater China net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, iPad\nand Services. The strength of the Chinese renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Greater\nChina net sales during 2021.\nJapan\nJapan net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone,\niPad and Services.

Products gross margin percentage\nincreased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Products mix, improved leverage and the\nstrength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a\ndifferent Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a\ndifferent Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be\nsubject to volatility and downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2021       Change            2020       Change            2019\nResearch and development               $  21,914           17  %    $  18,752           16  %    $  16,217\nPercentage of total net sales                  6  %                         7  %                         6  %\nSelling, general and administrative    $  21,973           10  %    $  19,916            9  %    $  18,245\nPercentage of total net sales                  6  %                         7  %                         7  %\nTotal operating expenses               $  43,887           13  %    $  38,668           12  %    $  34,462\nPercentage of total net sales                 12  %                        14  %                        13  %\nResearch and Development\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses,\nR&D-related professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused\ninvestments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the\ndevelopment of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases\nin headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 23\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (dollars in millions):\n2021    Change            2020    Change            2019\nInterest and dividend income         $   2,843                 $   3,763                 $   4,961\nInterest expense                        -2,645                    -2,873                    -3,576\nOther income/(expense), net                 60                       -87                       422\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $     258       -68  %    $     803       -56  %    $   1,807\nThe year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2021 was due primarily to lower interest income and net losses on\nmarketable securities, partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on non-marketable securities and lower\ninterest expense on term debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were\nas follows (dollars in millions):\n2021           2020            2019\nProvision for income taxes           $  14,527       $  9,680       $  10,481\nEffective tax rate                        13.3  %        14.4  %         15.9  %\nStatutory federal income tax rate           21  %          21  %           21  %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a\nlower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived\nintangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income\ntax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower compared to 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from\nforeign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation and the favorable impact of changes in\nunrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in\nresponse to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019.\nDuring 2021, the Company established deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) for foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland\nand increased DTAs for R&D tax credit carryforwards in California, which resulted in a combined $3.5 billion\nincrease in the valuation allowance on the Company’s DTAs, with no effect on net income. Management believes it is\nmore likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences, will be sufficient to realize substantially all of the Company’s remaining DTAs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled\n$172.6 billion as of September 25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12\nmonths and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nDebt\nAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\naggregate principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.6 billion payable within 12\nmonths. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $39.5 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12\nmonths.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was\npayable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 24\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing\nand data center space. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $14.6 billion,\nwith $1.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\n25, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, with $54.7 billion payable within 12\nmonths. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to\nadvertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of September 25, 2021, the Company\nhad other purchase obligations of $8.3 billion, with $4.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 25, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “Act”) was $24.6 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months.\nIn addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of\nDirectors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September 25,\n2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an\nannual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that\nwhich is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances,\nsuch as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a\nmanner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 25"

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the\neffective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures\nand, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and\noutstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income\nand expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the\ninterest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those\nsecurities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment\npolicy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based\non investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with\nvarying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding\nterm debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate\npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by\nthe corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest\nrates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 to\nincrease by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect\nagainst foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12\nmonths. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess\nthe potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation\nto generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company\nestimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021,\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions\nmay differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent\nlimitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27"

Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries\n(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the\nopinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are\nnormal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results\ncould differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September\nand the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the\n“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected\ncredit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified\nretrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will\nultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net\nincome in millions and shares in thousands):\nNumerator:                                  2021             2020             2019\nNet income                         $      94,680    $      57,411    $      55,256\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares         16,701,272       17,352,119       18,471,336\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities            163,647          176,095          124,315\nWeighted-average diluted shares       16,864,919       17,528,214       18,595,651\nBasic earnings per share           $        5.67    $        3.31    $        2.99\nDiluted earnings per share         $        5.61    $        3.28    $        2.97\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities.Potentially dilutive securities representing 62million shares of common stock were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-\nsale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\ninstrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities\nclassified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and\ntheir availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair\nvalue with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40years or the remaining life of the building; between\noneand five yearsfor machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and\nthe shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use\nsoftware are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\nfiveto seven years.Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 9.5billion, $ 9.7billion\nand $ 11.3billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable\nand other current liabilities of $ 2.9billion during 2019.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally\nrestricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines\ncurrent or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports\nrestricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nbased on the classification of the underlying securities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment\nfor derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are\ninitially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into\nearnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting\nlosses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts\ndesignated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair\nvalue of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as\naccounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative\ninstruments relate.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the\nCompany’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high\ncredit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud ® , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\non the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these\nundelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to,\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store\nand certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a\nnet basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\nauthorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 36\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 11.9billion and $\n10.2billion, respectively. As of September 25, 2021, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):\n2021          2020          2019\niPhone(1)                                $  191,973    $  137,781    $  142,381\nMac(1)                                       35,190        28,622        25,740\niPad(1)                                      31,862        23,724        21,280\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)        38,367        30,620        24,482\nServices(3)                                  68,425        53,768        46,291\nTotal net sales(4)                       $  365,817    $  274,515    $  260,174\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod, iPod touch and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and\nother services.

recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 37\nNote 3 – Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and

the State Aid Decision (refer to Note\n5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 38\nThe Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table\nshows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of\nSeptember 25, 2021 (in millions):\nDue after 1 year through 5 years      $   83,755\nDue after 5 years through 10 years        23,915\nDue after 10 years                        20,207\nTotal fair value                      $  127,877\nThe Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential\nrisk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in\nthe investment portfolio.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting\nfrom movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 25,\n2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected\nto be recognized within 21years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 25, 2021 and September 26,\n2020 were as follows (in millions):\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:                                2021         2020\nForeign exchange contracts                  $   76,475    $  57,410\nInterest rate contracts                     $   16,875    $  20,700\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  126,918    $  88,636\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of September 25, 2021\nand September 26, 2020.\nThe gains and losses recognized in OCI and amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income for the Company’s\nderivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 25, 2021 and September 26,\n2020 were as follows (in millions):\nHedged assets/(liabilities):                2021          2020\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $   15,954    $   16,270\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $  -17,857    $  -21,033\nThe gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged\nitem adjustments were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had nocustomers that individually represented 10%\nor more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42% of total trade\nreceivables as of September 25, 2021.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had threevendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.\nAs of September 26,

differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected\nto record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign\nearnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).\nAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had $ 2.6billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $\n1.6billion in California research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward\nindefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other\ntemporary differences.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 15.5billion, of which $\n6.6billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.5billion, of which $ 8.8billion, if recognized, would have\nimpacted the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for\n2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (in millions):\n2021         2020         2019\nBeginning balances                          $  16,475    $  15,619    $   9,694\nIncreases related to tax positions taken          816          454        5,845\nduring a prior year\nDecreases related to tax positions taken       -1,402         -791         -686\nduring a prior year\nIncreases related to tax positions taken        1,607        1,347        1,697\nduring the current year\nDecreases related to settlements with          -1,838          -85         -852\ntaxing authorities\nDecreases related to expiration of the           -181          -69          -79\nstatute of limitations\nEnding balances                             $  15,477    $  16,475    $  15,619\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and\nforeign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major\nforeign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of\nexaminations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 1.2billion.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42\nInterest and Penalties\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.As\nof September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $\n1.5billion and $ 1.4billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense of $ 219million, $\n85million and $ 73million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of\ntwosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan\nreduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs granted.\nRSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available\nfor grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All\nRSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the\nsame dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and\nconditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 760million shares were reserved for\nfuture issuance under the 2014 Plan.

The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the\nunderlying RSUs.

The majority of RSUs that vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were net share settled\nsuch that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable\nincome and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 53million, 56million and 59million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice.

The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that\niPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company\naccounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value\nof such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future\npayments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of\nSeptember 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):\n2022          $  4,551\n2023             2,165\n2024               984\n2025               405\n2026                51\nThereafter          28\nTotal         $  8,184\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a\nlegal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the\nultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for\nthat reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least\na reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products\ninfringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the\nverdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas\nDistrict Court, where a retrial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and\nawarded damages of $ 503million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the\npatents at issue in the retrial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the\npatents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.\niOS Performance Management Cases\nOn April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer\nintrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone\noperating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a\nMultidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict\nLitigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021,\nthe Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which\nwill result in an aggregate payment of $ 310million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its\niPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was\nintended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading\nstatements or fail to disclose any material information.\nFrench Competition Authority\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s\nsales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1billion. The\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.\nOptis\nOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents\nowned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages. In post-\ntrial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021\nand the jury in that proceeding awarded damages of $ 300million against the Company, which the Company plans to\nappeal.\nNote 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.”\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs\nexcluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development,\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges\nand other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes.\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nAmericas:                      2021          2020          2019\nNet sales                $  153,306    $  124,556    $  116,914\nOperating income         $   53,382    $   37,722    $   35,099\nEurope:\nNet sales                $   89,307    $   68,640    $   60,288\nOperating income         $   32,505    $   22,170    $   19,195\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $   68,366    $   40,308    $   43,678\nOperating income         $   28,504    $   15,261    $   16,232\nJapan:\nNet sales                $   28,482    $   21,418    $   21,506\nOperating income         $   12,798    $    9,279    $    9,369\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $   26,356    $   19,593    $   17,788\nOperating income         $    9,817    $    6,808    $    6,055\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021,\n2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions):\n2021          2020          2019\nSegment operating income            $  137,006    $   91,240    $   85,950\nResearch and development expense       -21,914       -18,752       -16,217\nOther corporate expenses, net           -6,143        -6,200        -5,803\nTotal operating income              $  108,949    $   66,288    $   63,930\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2021,\n2020 and 2019.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2021, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses\nDescription of the Matter    significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the\nimpact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax\nlaws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 52\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 28, 2021\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 53\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 28, 2021\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54"

The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 55"

Other Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nUnder Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any\nof its affiliates knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with entities or individuals designated pursuant to\ncertain Executive Orders.\nOn March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the “FSB”) as a\nblocked party under Executive Order 13382. On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign\nAssets Control updated General License No. 1B to authorize transactions and activities with the FSB that are\nnecessary and ordinarily incident to requesting, receiving, utilizing, paying for, or dealing in certain licenses,\npermits, certifications or notifications issued or registered by the FSB for the importation, distribution or use\nof certain information technology products in the Russian Federation.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended June 26,\n2021, during such period, the Company filed legally required administrative notifications with the FSB in\nconnection with the importation of the Company’s products into the Russian Federation, as permitted by General\nLicense No. 1B. The Company did not make any payments, nor did it receive gross revenues or net profits, in\nconnection with such engagement. The Company may in the future engage with the FSB for activities necessary to\nconduct business in the Russian Federation, in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations."

                "content": "Item 1. Business\nCompany Background\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories,\nand sells a variety of related services. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the\nlast Saturday of September.\nProducts\niPhone\niPhone ® is the Company’s line of smartphones based on its iOS operating system.

The offerings\nprovide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for\nrepair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or\ntheft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple\ndevices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store ® , that allow customers to discover and download\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade ® , a game\nsubscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music ® , which offers users a\ncurated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ ® , a subscription news and magazine\nservice; and Apple TV+ ® , which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a\ncashless payment service.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During\n2022, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%,\nrespectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and\nother forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business\nand that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\ntechnical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising\nfrom its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around\nthe world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property\nrights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\nto the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and\nsupportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000\nfull-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free\nof harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in\nthe Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to\nmeet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this,\nthe Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources\nthat are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative\nof the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level,\nfoster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged\nto come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge\nemployee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential\nworkplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with\ngeneral safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those\nworking in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security\nof its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional\nhealth and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially\nadversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can\nbe materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in\nthe real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and cost increases,\nlabor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products;\nand insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s\ntrade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and\ncould in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and\nbusiness operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\ndisruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and\nlogistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales\nworldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also adversely impact\nconsumer demand for the Company’s products and services in affected areas.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations\nand requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s\noperational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s\ncontrol, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the\ndevelopment, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective\npublic safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and\nservices. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s\nproducts and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to\nexecute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\nindustrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially\nall of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nAsia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and\nother international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international\ntrade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions\nwhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For\nexample, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports\nfrom China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products\nand the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross\nmargin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for\ncustomers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also\nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely\nimpact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services\nas designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,\nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the\nCompany’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts\nfurther escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\npandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\nnatural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies\nin the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels,\nresulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely\naffected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services,\neffectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the\ntransition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s\nability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for\nthe Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with\nanticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and\nservices.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant\nconcentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in\nsingle locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and\ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have\nan adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain\nprovisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for\nwarranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect\nliabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct,\nviolations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business,\nlabor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar\nterms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure\nfor the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the\nCompany’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component\ndefects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal\ninjury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including\nhealth. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as\nanticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect\nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in\nwidespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company\ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of\ninventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses,\nincluding litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\nintroductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a\ncommission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to\ntime, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and\nlegal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as\nthe European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to\nlitigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business\npractices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the\nCompany charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThis could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If\nthe rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in\nscope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19\npandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\ndistinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly\nskilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In\naddition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture,\nreputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the\nCompany is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and\nretain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells\nits products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\nstores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network\ndisruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of\nterrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents,\nor other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate,\nand the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things,\npreventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the\nmanufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious\nattacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in\npenalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can\nescalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other\nsensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems\nand services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like\nmultifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under\nsuspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede\ncustomer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for\nretail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\ninvestment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the\nCompany’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple\nstores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance\ncosts.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in\nthese actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such\nchallenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\nnot occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and\nrequire the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and\nservices.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item\n8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies”\nunder the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility\nthe Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled\nmonetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the\nCompany, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer\ncertain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital\ncontent; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption;\nimport, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering;\nforeign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling,\nand climate change.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer\na product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also\ncreate uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may\nincrease as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and\nfinancial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will\nnot violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have\nviolated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively\nmitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations\nrelating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in\nplace that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and\nprocedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s\nproducts could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse\ngas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes\nstatements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social\nand governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and\nother communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of\nthese goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve\nits announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may\ndisagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its\ngoals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international\nenvironmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and\nstandards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\ncompetition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New\nlegislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require\nfurther changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to\nits platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\nsignificant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject\nto litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may\nin the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms\nand apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal\nproceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-\nparty transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering\nimposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be\ninconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject\nto additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by\ngovernmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not\npermitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be\nsubject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and\ncan also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if\ncardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security\nstandards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the\nability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially\nadverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products\nin foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nand incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-\nmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant\nlosses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their\nvalue could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-\nsized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing\npartners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition,\nthe Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\ncomponents. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the\nCompany has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk\nand avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for\nincome taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The\nCompany’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory\ntax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be\nuncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount\nin excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention."

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a\ncounterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor\nof the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company\nwith respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that\ncertain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and\nissued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay\npending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults.

Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year\ncomparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\niPhone, Services and Mac. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-\nover-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022.\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant\nannouncements during fiscal 2022 included the following:\nFirst Quarter 2022:\nUpdated MacBook Pro 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and\nThird generation of AirPods.\nSecond Quarter 2022:\nUpdated iPhone SE with 5G technology;\nAll-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;\nAll-new Studio Display™; and\nUpdated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by the Apple M1 chip.\nThird Quarter 2022:\nUpdated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13”, both powered by the Apple M2 chip;\niOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to the Company’s operating systems; and\nApple Pay Later, a buy now, pay later service.\nFourth Quarter 2022:\niPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max;\nSecond generation of AirPods Pro; and\nApple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra.\nIn April 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion and\nraised its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company\nrepurchased $90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.8 billion.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments\nand businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global\nfinancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and\ncould in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have\nexperienced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could\noccur in the future.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 20\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):\nNet sales by category:                         2022    Change             2021    Change             2020\niPhone(1)                                $  205,489         7  %    $  191,973        39  %    $  137,781\nMac(1)                                       40,177        14  %        35,190        23  %        28,622\niPad(1)                                      29,292        -8  %        31,862        34  %        23,724\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)        41,241         7  %        38,367        25  %        30,620\nServices(3)                                  78,129        14  %        68,425        27  %        53,768\nTotal net sales                          $  394,328         8  %    $  365,817        33  %    $  274,515\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod mini and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and\nother services.

The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower\nthan the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate\non foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income\ndeductions and share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled\n$156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12\nmonths and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.\nDebt\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future\ninterest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was\npayable within 12 months.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3\nbillion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\n24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12\nmonths. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and\ncontent creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8\nbillion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board\nof Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24,\n2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an\nannual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation\nof the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that\nwhich is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances,\nsuch as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25"

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the\neffective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures\nand, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and\noutstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by\nfluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs\nassociated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment\npolicy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based\non investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company\nhad outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1\nbillion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate\nswaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to\neffectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate\npayments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related\nhedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\nCompany’s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an\nannualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect\nagainst foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12\nmonths. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess\nthe potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation\nto generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company\nestimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022,\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions\nmay differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent\nlimitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27"

Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries\n(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s\npresentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to\nparticular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\non the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\nservices.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for\nensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital\ncontent sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product\nbefore transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by\nrecognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities,\nwith the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government\nauthority.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will\nultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net\nincome in millions and shares in thousands):\nNumerator:                                  2022             2021             2020\nNet income                         $      99,803    $      94,680    $      57,411\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares         16,215,963       16,701,272       17,352,119\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities            109,856          163,647          176,095\nWeighted-average diluted shares       16,325,819       16,864,919       17,528,214\nBasic earnings per share           $        6.15    $        5.67    $        3.31\nDiluted earnings per share         $        6.11    $        5.61    $        3.28\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-\nsale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\ninstrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and\ntheir availability for use in current operations.\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35\nRestricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted.\nThe Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40years or the remaining life of the building; between\noneand five yearsfor machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term\nor useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from fiveto seven years.Depreciation\nand amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $ 8.7billion, $ 9.5billion and $ 9.7billion during\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment\nfor derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are\ninitially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into\nearnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting\nlosses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts\ndesignated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of\nthe hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized\nin OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as\naccounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative\ninstruments relate.\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the\nCompany’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high\ncredit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain\nforeign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of\ncorporate, data center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are\ngenerally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the\nCompany’s leases cannot be readily determined.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.”\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs\nexcluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development (“R&D”),\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges\nand other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n2022          2021          2020\niPhone(1)                                $  205,489    $  191,973    $  137,781\nMac(1)                                       40,177        35,190        28,622\niPad(1)                                      29,292        31,862        23,724\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)        41,241        38,367        30,620\nServices(3)                                  78,129        68,425        53,768\nTotal net sales(4)                       $  394,328    $  365,817    $  274,515\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod mini and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and\nother services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales\nprice of certain products.\n(4) Includes $ 7.5billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25,\n2021, $ 6.7billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020,\nand $ 5.0billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater China,\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales in 2022 and 2021.\nAs of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.4billion and $\n11.9billion, respectively. As of September 24, 2022, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 37\nNote 3 – Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and

Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24,\n2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash\nflows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:                                2022          2021\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  102,670    $   76,475\nInterest rate contracts                     $   20,125    $   16,875\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  185,381    $  126,918\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows\n(in millions):\n2022\nFair Value of                    Fair Value of\nDerivatives Designated       Derivatives Not Designated            Total\nDerivative assets(1):              as Accounting Hedges             as Accounting Hedges       Fair Value\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   4,317    $                       2,819    $       7,136\nDerivative liabilities(2):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   2,205    $                       2,547    $       4,752\nInterest rate contracts       $                   1,367    $                           —    $       1,367\n(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and\nother non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current\nliabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform.\nTo mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually\nestablished thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements\nwith the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to\nsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the\npotential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the\neffects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8billion,\nresulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nHedged assets/(liabilities):                2022          2021\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $   13,378    $   15,954\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $  -18,739    $  -17,857\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had onecustomer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,\nwhich accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade\nreceivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of\nSeptember 25, 2021, the Company had threevendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-\ntrade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form

Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of\nexaminations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 4.8billion.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of\ntwosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 41million, 53million and 56million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $ 6.4billion, $ 6.8billion and $\n3.9billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 47\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n2022         2021         2020\nShare-based compensation expense    $   9,038    $   7,906    $   6,829\nIncome tax benefit related to       $  -4,002    $  -4,056    $  -2,476\nshare-based compensation expense\nAs of September 24, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options\nwas $ 16.7billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6years.\nNote 10 – Commitments and Contingencies\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable\nunconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022, are as\nfollows (in millions):\n2023          $  13,488\n2024              4,876\n2025              1,418\n2026              6,780\n2027                312\nThereafter          412\nTotal         $  27,286\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\nmaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 48\nNote 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nAmericas:                      2022          2021          2020\nNet sales                $  169,658    $  153,306    $  124,556\nOperating income         $   62,683    $   53,382    $   37,722\nEurope:\nNet sales                $   95,118    $   89,307    $   68,640\nOperating income         $   35,233    $   32,505    $   22,170\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $   74,200    $   68,366    $   40,308\nOperating income         $   31,153    $   28,504    $   15,261\nJapan:\nNet sales                $   25,977    $   28,482    $   21,418\nOperating income         $   12,257    $   12,798    $    9,279\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $   29,375    $   26,356    $   19,593\nOperating income         $   11,569    $    9,817    $    6,808\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2022,\n2021 and 2020 is as follows (in millions):\n2022          2021          2020\nSegment operating income            $  152,895    $  137,006    $   91,240\nResearch and development expense       -26,251       -21,914       -18,752\nOther corporate expenses, net           -7,207        -6,143        -6,200\nTotal operating income              $  119,437    $  108,949    $   66,288\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2022,\n2021 and 2020.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8billion, of which $8.0billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for\nDescription of the Matter    uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the\ninterpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 51\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52"

                "content": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53"

                "content": "Item 1. Business\nCompany Background\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories,\nand sells a variety of related services.

The offerings\nprovide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for\nrepair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft\nand loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple\ndevices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store ® , that allow customers to discover and download\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade ® , a game\nsubscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music ® , which offers users a\ncurated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ ® , a subscription news and magazine\nservice; and Apple TV+ ® , which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a\ncashless payment service.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a\nvariety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\nand resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted\nfor 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and\nother forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business\nand that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\ntechnical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising\nfrom its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around\nthe world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property\nrights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\nto the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and\nsupportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000\nfull-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free\nof harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in\nthe Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to\nmeet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this,\nthe Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources\nthat are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of\nthe communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster\nan inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged\nto come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge\nemployee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential\nworkplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with\ngeneral safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those\nworking in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security\nof its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit,\nhigher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial\nmarket volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline\nin, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business\noperations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\nindustrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially\nall of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs\nand other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and\nservices to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain\noperations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,\nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the\nCompany’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-\nconsuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example,\ntensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions\nbeing imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by\ngovernments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\npandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\nnatural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more\nintense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\nproducts to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and\ndemand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery\ntime, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company\nrelies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business\ninterruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and\ndelays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely\naffected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services,\neffectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the\ntransition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s\nability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory\nlevels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at\nexpected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other\ndefects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and\ntransitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes\nor additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks\nand uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these\narrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and\ndistribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the\nquality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to\nrespond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect\nexpense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty\nservice in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code\nof conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business,\nlabor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply\nof many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\nsimilar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business\nfailure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to\nobtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or\nregional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance\ndepend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect\nthe Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\nComponent defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage\nand personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time\nto time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have\nnot performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be\nable to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so\ncan result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In\naddition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications,\nwrite-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other\nexpenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the\nexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss\nof competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product\nand service introductions and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission\nfrom sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to\ntime, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market\nconditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the\nfuture, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”)\nDigital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to\nlitigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business\npractices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with\nconsumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what\nthe Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App\nStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns\non those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or\nif it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\ndistinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly\nskilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In\naddition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture,\nreputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the\nCompany is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and\nretain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells\nits products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\nstores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to\ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power\ndisruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-\nins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and\nother continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity\nand disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can\nadversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services,\ninterfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These\nevents could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other\nmalicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in\npenalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can\nescalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive\ninformation, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and\nservices. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like\nmultifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under\nsuspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede\ncustomer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often\nenter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property\nrights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well\nas internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and\nsubstantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such\nchallenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\nnot occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and\nrequire the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and\nservices.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item\n8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and\nSupply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a\nreasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled\nmonetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the\nCompany, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business\npractices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\nrepatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer\na product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services,\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply\nchain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and\nregulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has\nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there\ncan be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or\nthe Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with\nlittle or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in\npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations\nexpose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the\nCompany’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse\ngas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes\nstatements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its\nwebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires\ninvestments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The\nCompany cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or\nperceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,\ncomply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet\nevolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against\nthe Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\nfurther business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store,\nsuch as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in\nother jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store\nregarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers\nfor access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what\nextent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing\nmechanisms.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\nsignificant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject\nto litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may\nin the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms\nand applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal\nproceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection,\nuse, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not\nonly to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its\ninternational subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are\nconsidering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may\nbe inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject\nto additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by\ngovernmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not\npermitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be\nsubject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and\ncan also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if\ncardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security\nstandards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the\nability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially\nadverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales,\ncost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on\nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could\nin the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nor incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to\noffset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange\nrates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may\nfluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-\nsized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing\npartners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition,\nthe Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\ncomponents. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the\nCompany has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk\nand avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore,\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and\ntax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\nchange. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for\nmodernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s\neffective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax\nlaws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be\nsubject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nor if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously\naccrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention."

                "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s\nunfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The\nDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s\nunfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in\ntheir apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023,\nthe Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30,\n2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay\nenforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s\npetition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\nMasimo\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the\nfunctionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a\npermanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include\nblood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”)\nprohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing\nfunctionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of\nthe administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to\nappeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected."

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its\nprevious repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the\nCompany to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately\nnegotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\n(2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms\nof the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the\npurchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately\ndelivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the\nvolume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 18\nCompany Stock Performance\nThe following graph shows a comparison of five-year cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend-\nreinvested basis, for the Company, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index.

foreign currencies relative to\nthe U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix.\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different\nProducts mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased\nleverage.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially\noffset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the\nweakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be\nsubject to volatility and downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as

growth in R&D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021

14.7  %         16.2  %         13.3  %\nStatutory federal income tax rate           21  %           21  %           21  %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due\nprimarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on\nforeign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled\n$148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12\nmonths and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\nDebt\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future\ninterest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within\n12 months.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8\nbillion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing\npurchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing\npurchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements,\nlicensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\nother purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The\nprogram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual\nbasis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation\nof the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that\nwhich is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances,\nsuch as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25"

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various\nstrategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the\nCompany’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against\ninterest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and\nliabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the\neffects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as\nof September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate           Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument    Rate Increase                   Potential Impact                       2023        2022\nInvestment portfolio    100 basis points, all tenors    Decline in fair value              $  3,089    $  4,022\nTerm debt               100 basis points, all tenors    Increase in annual interest        $    194    $    201\nexpense\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations\nin exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect\nagainst foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local\ncurrency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign\ncurrency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the\npotential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the\nmaximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95%\nconfidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and\nSeptember 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were\nexcluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26"

Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the\nuse of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53\nweeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular\nyears, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards\nthat will ultimately vest.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash\nequivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain\nforeign earnings created by the Act.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of\ncorporate, data center and retail facilities.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\nNote 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or\nservices is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to\npayment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\ncustomers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the\nCompany’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\nservices, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\non the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\nservices.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for\nensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does\nnot obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all\nthird-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it\nretains.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2023          2022          2021\niPhone(1)                             $  200,583    $  205,489    $  191,973\nMac(1)                                    29,357        40,177        35,190\niPad(1)                                   28,300        29,292        31,862\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)        39,845        41,241        38,367\nServices(2)                               85,200        78,129        68,425\nTotal net sales                       $  383,285    $  394,328    $  365,817\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain\nproducts.\nTotal net sales include $ 8.2billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 24, 2022, $ 7.5billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 25, 2021, and $ 6.7billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 26, 2020.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China,\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.1billion and $\n12.4billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than\nthree

The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\n12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length\nof time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 19years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross\nmargins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency\ngains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow\nor fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24,\n2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:                                2023          2022\nForeign exchange contracts                  $   74,730    $  102,670\nInterest rate contracts                     $   19,375    $   20,125\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  104,777    $  185,381\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows\n(in millions):\n2022\nFair Value of                    Fair Value of\nDerivatives Designated       Derivatives Not Designated            Total\nDerivative assets(1):              as Accounting Hedges             as Accounting Hedges       Fair Value\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   4,317    $                       2,819    $       7,136\nDerivative liabilities(2):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   2,205    $                       2,547    $       4,752\nInterest rate contracts       $                   1,367    $                           —    $       1,367\n(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and\nother non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current\nliabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform.\nTo mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to\nbe received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established\nthresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the\nrespective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle\ntransactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential\neffects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8billion, resulting in\na net derivative asset of $ 412million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24,\n2022 were as follows (in millions):\nHedged assets/(liabilities):                2023          2022\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $   14,433    $   13,378\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $  -18,247    $  -18,739\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had onecustomer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,\nwhich accounted for 10%. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total\ntrade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The Company requires third-party\ncredit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in\nproducts net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales\nwhen the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May\n23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to\nclaim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due\nrelated to the State Aid Decision.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally\nvest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common\nstock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle\nholders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately\n1.3billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on\nMarch 4, 2022.\n2014 Employee Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-\nbased equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of\nsubstantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan.

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments\nunder noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\n30, 2023, are as follows (in millions):\n2024          $   4,258\n2025              2,674\n2026              3,434\n2027              1,277\n2028              5,878\nThereafter        3,215\nTotal         $  20,736\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\nmaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5billion, of which $9.5billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some\nDescription of the Matter    of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the\ninterpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 2, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24,\n2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated\nNovember 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 2, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51"

                "content": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 52"

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a\nvariety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\nand resellers. During 2024, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted\nfor 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets\nand other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business\nand that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\ntechnical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising\nfrom its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around\nthe world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property\nrights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\nto the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and\nretain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its\nteam members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had\napproximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in\nthe Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to\nmeet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this,\nthe Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time\naway.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers\nprograms through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values.\nTeam members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as\nlearning opportunities to support their well-being.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free\nof harassment or discrimination.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of\nthe communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster\nan inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged\nto come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge\nemployee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential\nworkplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with\ngeneral safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those\nworking in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security\nof its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit,\nhigher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial\nmarket volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline\nin, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business\noperations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse\neffect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially\nall of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs\nand other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply\nto countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\nsupply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components\nand raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing\nsuppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain\nin accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which\ncan create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs\nand other restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future,\nactions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global\nclimate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or\nwith more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to\nthe risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents,\nterrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\nissues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated\nand geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its\ncustomers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns\nand outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer\nspending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and\ndelays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage\nfor certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely\naffected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services,\neffectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the\ntransition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s\nability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services, the effective management\nof purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products\nin appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and\nservices may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or\nsupersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially\nadversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance\nthe Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The\nCompany has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower\noperating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished\ncontrol has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.\nAlthough arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the\nCompany generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of\nproduct defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company\nrelies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur\nfrom time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor,\nenvironmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or\nconflict.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\ndisrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant\nrisks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply\nof many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\nsimilar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can\nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the\nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can\nmaterially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\nComponent defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage\nand personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time\nto time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have\nnot performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including\nexposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the\nCompany will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.\nFailure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and\nservices. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security\nof a user’s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and\nsignificant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can\nadversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the\nCompany’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products,\nservices or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company\nretains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an\napplication. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions\nin response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to\nmake further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and\nSafari ® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new\nbusiness terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS\nand iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional\ntools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and\nservices could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\nincluding if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the\ncommission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope\nor eliminated.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\ndistinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly\nskilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In\naddition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture,\nreputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the\nCompany is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and\nretain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells\nits products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\nstores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to\ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power\ndisruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-\nins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and\nother continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity\nand disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can\nadversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services,\ninterfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These\nevents could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other\nmalicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in\npenalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can\nescalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its suppliers’ and other third parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames,\npasswords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or\nsuch suppliers’ or third parties’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company\ndeploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in\nthe delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often\nenter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property\nrights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well\nas internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief\nand substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such\nchallenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\nnot occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and\nrequire the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and\nservices.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of\nrevenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time\nrequired, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s\nability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\nrepatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer\na product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services,\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business\nor supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and\nregulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company\nexpands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate\nnew legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented\npolicies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\nCompany’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with\nlittle or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in\npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations\nexpose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the\nCompany’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse\ngas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes\nstatements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its\nwebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations and implementation of the Company’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and\nuncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the\nCompany’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and\ngovernance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and\ninitiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives,\nadhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance\nlaws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and\nregulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\nfurther business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply\nwith the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative\nmethods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s\noperating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to\nits compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”).\nAlthough the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the\nCommission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties\nfor noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While\nthe changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA\nposes to EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around\nthe world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the\naggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of\nU.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions\nrelating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company,\nthe Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business\npractices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the\nCompany’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government\ninvestigations and legal proceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection,\nuse, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not\nonly to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its\ninternational subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are\nconsidering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may\nbe inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject\nto additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by\ngovernmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not\npermitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be\nsubject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and\ncan also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if\ncardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security\nstandards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the\nability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\nincluding new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially\nadverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or\nmanufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales,\ncost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on\nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could\nin the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nor incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to\noffset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange\nrates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may\nfluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-\nsized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing\npartners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition,\nthe Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\ncomponents. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the\nCompany has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk\nand avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore,\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and\ntax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\nchange. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for\nmodernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s\neffective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax\nlaws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be\nsubject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nor if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously\naccrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not\nobligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future\ngrowth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock\nmay decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\nretention."

                "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the\nCompany under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how\ndevelopers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as\nhow developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission\nannounced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules\nare in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company\nregarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces\nmay violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a\ncease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any\ndecision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s\norder would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company\nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to\nfeedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company\nalleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”\nin violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their\napps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company\nimplemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District\nCourt. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a\nmotion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has\nsubstantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected."

will be\nsubject to volatility and downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2024       Change            2023

2023            2022\nProvision for income taxes           $  29,749       $  16,741       $  19,300\nEffective tax rate                        24.1  %         14.7  %         16.2  %\nStatutory federal income tax rate           21  %           21  %           21  %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a\none-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income\nTaxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income\ntaxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D\ncredit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax charge\nof $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower\ntax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled\n$140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12\nmonths and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\nDebt\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $97.3 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future\ninterest payments associated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024, the Company had $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within\n12 months.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.6\nbillion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing\npurchase obligations of $53.0 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements,\nlicensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had\nother purchase obligations of $12.0 billion, with $4.1 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 28, 2024, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was $16.5 billion, with $7.2 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 25\nState Aid Decision Tax Payable\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had an obligation to pay €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion to Ireland in\nconnection with the State Aid Decision, all of which was expected to be paid within 12 months. The funds necessary\nto settle the obligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The\nprogram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the\nCompany’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual\nbasis, subject to declaration by the Board.\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly\ndividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of\nits common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\nNo. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require\nthe Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the\nCompany to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further\ndisaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth\nquarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are\nsignificant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU\n2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment\nprofit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company\nwill adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation\nof the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights\nbetween countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves.\nReserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material\nimpact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26"

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various\nstrategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the\nCompany’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against\ninterest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and\nliabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the\neffects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as\nof September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate           Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument    Rate Increase                   Potential Impact                       2024        2023\nInvestment portfolio    100 basis points, all tenors    Decline in fair value              $  2,755    $  3,089\nTerm debt               100 basis points, all tenors    Increase in annual interest        $    139    $    194\nexpense\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations\nin exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect\nagainst foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local\ncurrency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign\ncurrency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the\npotential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the\nmaximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95%\nconfidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were\nexcluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27"

Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the\nuse of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2022\nspanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular\nyears, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards\nthat will ultimately vest.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash\nequivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain\nforeign earnings created by the TCJA.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of\ncorporate, data center and retail facilities.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 34\nNote 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or\nservices is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to\npayment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\ncustomers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the\nCompany’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\nservices, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of\niPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the\nallocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material\nperformance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® ,\nSiri ® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations\nbased on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the\nallocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and\nbundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the\nproduct is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\nservices.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for\nensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does\nnot obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all\nthird-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it\nretains.\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2024          2023          2022\niPhone                             $  201,183    $  200,583    $  205,489\nMac                                    29,984        29,357        40,177\niPad                                   26,694        28,300        29,292\nWearables, Home and Accessories        37,005        39,845        41,241\nServices(1)                            96,169        85,200        78,129\nTotal net sales                    $  391,035    $  383,285    $  394,328\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain\nproducts.\nTotal net sales include $ 7.7billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, $ 8.2billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 24, 2022, and $ 7.5billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 25, 2021.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China,\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.8billion and $\n12.1billion, respectively.

The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s\nunderlying maturity.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\n12months.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 37\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum length\nof time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 18years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross\nmargins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency\ngains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company requires third-party credit support or\ncollateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in\nproducts net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales\nwhen the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion.\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount\nfor certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of € 12.7billion\nplus interest of € 1.2billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow,\nincluding net unrealized investment gains, was € 14.2billion or $ 15.8billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $\n2.6billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $ 13.2billion was classified as current marketable\nsecurities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section\nof Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 39\nThe Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On\nSeptember 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the\n“ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023.

The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 31million, 37million and 41million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice.

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments\nunder unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2024, are\nas follows (in millions):\n2025          $   3,206\n2026              2,440\n2027              1,156\n2028              3,121\n2029                633\nThereafter          670\nTotal         $  11,226\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 45\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\nmaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information\nprovided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment\nperformance excludes asset information.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 46\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\nAmericas:                      2024          2023          2022\nNet sales                $  167,045    $  162,560    $  169,658\nOperating income         $   67,656    $   60,508    $   62,683\nEurope:\nNet sales                $  101,328    $   94,294    $   95,118\nOperating income         $   41,790    $   36,098    $   35,233\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $   66,952    $   72,559    $   74,200\nOperating income         $   27,082    $   30,328    $   31,153\nJapan:\nNet sales                $   25,052    $   24,257    $   25,977\nOperating income         $   12,454    $   11,888    $   12,257\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $   30,658    $   29,615    $   29,375\nOperating income         $   13,062    $   12,066    $   11,569\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024,\n2023 and 2022 is as follows (in millions):\n2024          2023          2022\nSegment operating income            $  162,044    $  150,888    $  152,895\nResearch and development expense       -31,370       -29,915       -26,251\nOther corporate expenses, net(1)        -7,458        -6,672        -7,207\nTotal operating income              $  123,216    $  114,301    $  119,437\n(1) Includes general and administrative compensation costs, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately\nmanaged costs.\nThe following tables show net sales for 2024, 2023 and 2022 and long-lived assets as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 for countries that individually accounted for 10% or more of the respective totals, as well as\naggregate amounts for the remaining countries (in millions):\nNet sales:               2024          2023          2022\nU.S.               $  142,196    $  138,573    $  147,859\nChina(1)               66,952        72,559        74,200\nOther countries       181,887       172,153       172,269\nTotal net sales    $  391,035    $  383,285    $  394,328\nLong-lived assets:              2024         2023\nU.S.                       $  35,664    $  33,276\nChina(1)                       4,797        5,778\nOther countries                5,219        4,661\nTotal long-lived assets    $  45,680    $  43,715\n(1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 47\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024\nand September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’\nequity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28,\n2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to\nincome taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28,\n2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of\nwhich $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.\nIn accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses\nDescription of the Matter    significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex\ndomestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions\nthat qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.\nWe evaluated the Company’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not\nto be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies\nfor recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of the Company’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, we\nalso received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter\nwith external advisors and the Company’s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the\nCompany’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial\nstatements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50"

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 51"
