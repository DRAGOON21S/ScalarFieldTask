Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided SEC Form 8-K filings for Microsoft Corporation from 2020 through 2025, the following report details all material events as disclosed in the documents.

### **Executive Summary**

The provided 8-K filings for Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft" or "the Company") from 2020 through 2025 report several significant material events. These include major strategic acquisitions, a material cybersecurity incident, corporate restructuring involving workforce reductions, financial reporting changes, and regular disclosures of quarterly earnings and shareholder meeting results.

Key events include the announcements and completions of acquisitions of ZeniMax Media for $7.5 billion (2020), Nuance Communications for $19.7 billion (2021), and Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard") for $95.00 per share (announced 2022, completed 2023). A material cybersecurity incident was reported in a 2024 filing, detailing a nation-state attack detected in January 2024.

Financially, the filings disclose a $1.2 billion restructuring charge in fiscal year 2023 related to workforce reductions and other changes, and an expected impairment charge of approximately $800 million in fiscal year 2025 related to an investment in Cruise. The documents also cover debt management activities, including a note redemption in 2021 and a large-scale debt exchange offer related to Activision Blizzard notes in 2023.

The user's query regarding a link between these events and key risk factors identified in a Form 10-K cannot be addressed, as the provided 8-K filings do not contain or reference a "Risk Factors" section from a 10-K. Analysis is therefore strictly limited to the content within the provided documents.

    The provided 8-K filing data does not contain a "Risk Factors" section as would be found in a Form 10-K or 10-Q. Therefore, a direct analysis linking the reported events to specific, pre-disclosed risk factors is not possible based on the source documents. The filings do not specify which, if any, of these events directly relate to key risk factors identified in other reports.
