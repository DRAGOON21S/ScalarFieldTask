Based on an analysis of the provided SEC Form 8-K filing data for Microsoft Corporation in 2024, the following report details material events relevant to the company's risk profile.

### **Executive Summary**

The provided 2024 Form 8-K filings for Microsoft Corporation disclose several material events, including a significant cybersecurity incident, a substantial financial impairment related to a minority investment, changes to financial segment reporting, and the results of its annual shareholder meeting. These events touch upon cybersecurity risks, financial performance, and corporate governance.

*   **Cybersecurity Incident:** In a filing under Item 1.05, Microsoft reported a nation-state associated cyberattack detected in January 2024. The attack, which began in late November 2023, resulted in the exfiltration of data from the email accounts of senior leadership and employees in cybersecurity and legal functions. The company stated the incident has not had a material operational impact as of the filing date, but the potential financial impact is still under determination.
*   **Investment Impairment:** Under Item 7.01, Microsoft disclosed an expected impairment charge of approximately $800 million related to its minority investment in Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company. This follows a strategic shift announced by General Motors Company. The charge is projected to negatively impact diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.
*   **Leadership and Governance:** A filing under Item 5.07 details the results of the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting. All 12 director nominees, including CEO Satya Nadella, were re-elected, indicating stability in the board's composition. No changes to executive leadership were announced in this filing.
*   **Partnerships and Legal Proceedings:** The filings do not explicitly mention the formation of major new partnerships. The disclosure regarding the Cruise investment provides an update on a prior partnership. The cybersecurity incident filing notes that "law enforcement" and "relevant regulatory authorities" have been notified, which constitutes a legal and regulatory matter. No other significant legal proceedings are detailed in the provided data.
