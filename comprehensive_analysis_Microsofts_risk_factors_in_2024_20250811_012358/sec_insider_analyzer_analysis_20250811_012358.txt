Based on the SEC Form 4 data provided for Microsoft Corporation for the period of January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, here is a comprehensive analysis of the recent insider trading activity for its key executives.

### 1. Summary of Filing Activity

In January 2024, a total of nine Form 4 filings were submitted by Microsoft insiders. One filing was from a key executive (Chief Accounting Officer), and eight were from members of the Board of Directors.

The most significant finding from this data is that **none of the nine filings reported any buy or sell transactions.** All transaction tables within the provided forms are empty, indicating no change in beneficial ownership through acquisition or disposition of shares for these insiders during the reported period.

The filings were made by the following individuals. Notably, no filings from the CEO (Satya Nadella) or CFO (Amy Hood) are present in this dataset.

### 3. Transaction Details (2024)

*   **Buy Transactions:**
    *   **Total Shares Purchased:** 0
    *   **Total Value:** $0.00
*   **Sell Transactions:**
    *   **Total Shares Sold:** 0
    *   **Total Value:** $0.00

Both "Table I - Non-Derivative Securities" and "Table II - Derivative Securities" were empty across all nine filings, confirming the absence of any reported trades.

### 4. Notable Patterns or Trends

*   **Absence of Trading:** The most prominent trend is the complete lack of any reported open-market buy or sell activity among the filers in this dataset.
*   **Coordinated Director Filings:** There is a distinct pattern of eight different directors filing their Form 4s on the same day, **January 31, 2024**. This synchronized reporting, combined with the absence of transactions, may suggest a routine, non-eventful disclosure requirement, such as confirming holdings after a board meeting or at the end of a fiscal quarter.

### 5. Significant Observations

The primary observation is that while Form 4s were filed, they served as a declaration of no change in ownership via trades for the individuals listed. Answering your query directly:

**Based on this specific data, there has been no recent Form 4 insider trading activity (neither buys nor sells) by Microsoft's key executives or directors in 2024.**

It's important to note that Form 4s can be filed for various reasons beyond open-market trades, such as the grant, vesting, or exercise of stock options. However, the provided data shows no such activity was reported in these specific filings.
